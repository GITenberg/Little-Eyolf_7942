description: Guilt and grief hold equal sway over the characters in Ibsen's 'Little
  Eyolf', in which a couple must come to terms with the death of a child. Alfred,
  the child's father, is wracked with guilt for his failure to protect his son. Rita,
  his wife, struggles desperately to regain her husband's attention as their marriage
  crumbles around them. Both are haunted by past resentments even as they struggle
  with present tragedy. 'Little Eyolf', one of Ibsen's last plays, premiered at the
  Deutsches Theater in Berlin in 1895.
