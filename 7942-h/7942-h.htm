    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Little Eyolf was written in Christiania during 1894, and published in
      Copenhagen on December 11 in that year. By this time Ibsen's
      correspondence has become so scanty as to afford us no clue to what may be
      called the biographical antecedents of the play. Even of anecdotic history
      very little attaches to it. For only one of the characters has a definite
      model been suggested. Ibsen himself told his French translator, Count
      Prozor, that the original of the Rat-Wife was "a little old woman who came
      to kill rats at the school where he was educated. She carried a little dog
      in a bag, and it was said that children had been drowned through following
      her." This means that Ibsen did not himself adapt to his uses the legend
      so familiar to us in Browning's <i>Pied Piper of Hamelin</i>, but found it
      ready adapted by the popular imagination of his native place, Skien. "This
      idea," Ibsen continued to Count Prozor, "was just what I wanted for
      bringing about the disappearance of Little Eyolf, in whom the infatuation
      [Note: The French word used by Count Prozor is "infatuation." I can think
      of no other rendering for it; but I do not quite know what it means as
      applied to Allmers and Eyolf.] and the feebleness of his father
      reproduced, but concentrated, exaggerated, as one often sees them in the
      son of such a father." Dr. Elias tells us that a well-known lady-artist,
      who in middle life suggested to him the figure of Lona Hessel, was in
      later years the model for the Rat-Wife. There is no inconsistency between
      these two accounts of the matter. The idea was doubtless suggested by his
      recollection of the rat-catcher of Skien, while traits of manner and
      physiognomy might be borrowed from the lady in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The verse quoted on pp. 52 and 53 [Transcriber's Note: "There stood the
      champagne," etc., in ACT I] is the last line of a very well-known poem by
      Johan Sebastian Welhaven, entitled <i>Republikanerne</i>, written in 1839.
      An unknown guest in a Paris restaurant has been challenged by a noisy
      party of young Frenchmen to join them in drinking a health to Poland. He
      refuses; they denounce him as a craven and a slave; he bares his breast
      and shows the scars of wounds received in fighting for the country whose
      lost cause has become a subject for conventional enthusiasm and windy
      rhetoric.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "De saae pas hverandre. Han vandred sin vei.
    De havde champagne, men rörte den ei."
</pre>
    <p>
      "They looked at each other. He went on his way. There stood their
      champagne, but they did not touch it." The champagne incident leads me to
      wonder whether the relation between Rita and Allmers may not have been
      partly suggested to Ibsen by the relation between Charlotte Stieglitz and
      her weakling of a husband. Their story must have been known to him through
      George Brandes's <i>Young Germany</i>, if not more directly. "From time to
      time," says Dr. Brandes, "there came over her what she calls her
      champagne-mood; she grieves that this is no longer the case with him."
      [Note: <i>Main Currents of Nineteenth Century Literature</i>, vol. vi. p.
      299] Did the germ of the incident lie in these words?
    </p>
    <p>
      The first performance of the play in Norway took place at the Christiania
      Theatre on January 15, 1895, Fru Wettergren playing Rita And Fru Dybwad,
      Asta. In Copenhagen (March 13, 1895) Fru Oda Nielsen and Fru Hennings
      played Rita and Asta respectively, while Emil Poulsen played Allmers. The
      first German Rita (Deutsches Theater, Berlin, January 12, 1895) was Frau
      Agnes Sorma, with Reicher as Allmers. Six weeks later Frl. Sandrock played
      Rita at the Burgtheater, Vienna. In May 1895 the play was acted by M.
      Lugné-Poë's company in Paris. The first performance in English took place
      at the Avenue Theatre, London, on the afternoon of November 23, 1896, with
      Miss Janet Achurch as Rita, Miss Elizabeth Robins as Asta, and Mrs.
      Patrick Campbell as the Rat-Wife. Miss Achurch's Rita made a profound
      impression. Mrs. Patrick Campbell afterwards played the part in a short
      series of evening performances. In the spring of 1895 the play was acted
      in Chicago by a company of Scandinavian amateurs, presumably in Norwegian.
      Fru Oda Nielsen has recently (I understand) given some performances of it
      in New York, and Madame Alla Nazimova has announced it for production
      during the coming season (1907-1908).
    </p>
    <p>
      As the external history of <i>Little Eyolf</i> is so short. I am tempted
      to depart from my usual practice, and say a few words as to its matter and
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Brandes, writing of this play, has rightly observed that "a kind of
      dualism has always been perceptible in Ibsen; he pleads the cause of
      Nature, and he castigates Nature with mystic morality; only sometimes
      Nature is allowed the first voice, sometimes morality. In <i>The Master
      Builder</i> and in <i>Ghosts</i> the lover of Nature in Ibsen was
      predominant; here, as in <i>Brand</i> and <i>The Wild Duck</i>, the
      castigator is in the ascendant." So clearly is this the case in <i>Little
      Eyolf</i> that Ibsen seems almost to fall into line with Mr. Thomas Hardy.
      To say nothing of analogies of detail between <i>Little Eyolf</i> and <i>Jude
      the Obscure</i>, there is this radical analogy, that they are both
      utterances of a profound pessimism, both indictments of Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while Mr. Hardy's pessimism is plaintive and passive, Ibsen's is
      stoical and almost bracing. It is true that in this play he is no longer
      the mere "indignation pessimist" whom Dr. Brandes quite justly recognised
      in his earlier works. His analysis has gone deeper into the heart of
      things, and he has put off the satirist and the iconoclast. But there is
      in his thought an incompressible energy of revolt. A pessimist in
      contemplation, he remains a meliorist in action. He is not, like Mr.
      Hardy, content to let the flag droop half-mast high; his protagonist still
      runs it up to the mast-head, and looks forward steadily to the "heavy day
      of work" before him. But although the note of the conclusion is resolute,
      almost serene, the play remains none the less an indictment of Nature, or
      at least of that egoism of passion which is one of her most potent
      subtleties. In this view, Allmers becomes a type of what we may roughly
      call the "free moral agent"; Eyolf, a type of humanity conceived as
      passive and suffering, thrust will-less into existence, with boundless
      aspirations and cruelly limited powers; Rita, a type of the egoistic
      instinct which is "a consuming fire"; and Asta, a type of the beneficent
      love which is possible only so long as it is exempt from "the law of
      change." Allmers, then, is self-conscious egoism, egoism which can now and
      then break its chains, look in its own visage, realise and shrink from
      itself; while Rita, until she has passed through the awful crisis which
      forms the matter of the play, is unconscious, reckless, and ruthless
      egoism, exigent and jealous, "holding to its rights," and incapable even
      of rising into the secondary stage of maternal love. The offspring and the
      victim of these egoisms is Eyolf, "little wounded warrior," who longs to
      scale the heights and dive into the depths, but must remain for ever
      chained to the crutch of human infirmity. For years Allmers has been a
      restless and half-reluctant slave to Rita's imperious temperament. He has
      dreamed and theorised about "responsibility," and has kept Eyolf poring
      over his books, in the hope that, despite his misfortune, he may one day
      minister to parental vanity. Finally he breaks away from Rita, for the
      first time "in all these ten years," goes up "into the infinite
      solitudes," looks Death in the face, and returns shrinking from passion,
      yearning towards selfless love, and filled with a profound and remorseful
      pity for the lot of poor maimed humanity. He will "help Eyolf to bring his
      desires into harmony with what lies attainable before him." He will
      "create a conscious happiness in his mind." And here the drama opens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the Rat-Wife enters, let me pause for a moment to point out that
      here again Ibsen adopts that characteristic method which, in writing of <i>The
      Lady from the Sea</i> and <i>The Master Builder</i>, I have compared to
      the method of Hawthorne. The story he tells is not really, or rather not
      inevitably, supernatural. Everything is explicable within this limits of
      nature; but supernatural agency is also vaguely suggested, and the
      reader's imagination is stimulated, without any absolute violence to his
      sense of reality. On the plane of everyday life, then, the Rat-Wife is a
      crazy and uncanny old woman, fabled by the peasants to be a were-wolf in
      her leisure moments, who goes about the country killing vermin. Coming
      across an impressionable child, she tells him a preposterous tale, adapted
      from the old "Pied Piper" legends, of her method of fascinating her
      victims. The child, whose imagination has long dwelt on this personage, is
      in fact hypnotised by her, follows her down to the sea, and, watching her
      row away, turns dizzy, falls in, and is drowned. There is nothing
      impossible, nothing even improbable, in this. At the same time, there
      cannot be the least doubt, I think, that in the poet's mind the Rat-Wife
      is the symbol of Death, of the "still, soft darkness" that is at once so
      fearful and so fascinating to humanity. This is clear not only in the text
      of her single scene, but in the fact that Allmers, in the last act, treats
      her and his "fellow-traveller" of that night among the mountains, not
      precisely as identical, but as interchangeable, ideas. To tell the truth,
      I have even my own suspicions as to who is meant by "her sweetheart," whom
      she "lured" long ago, and who is now "down where all the rats are." This
      theory I shall keep to myself; it may be purely fantastic, and is at best
      inessential. What is certain is that death carries off Little Eyolf, and
      that, of all he was, only the crutch is left, mute witness to his hapless
      lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is gone; there was so little to bind him to life that he made not even
      a moment's struggle against the allurement of the "long, sweet sleep."
      Then, for the first time, the depth of the egoism which had created and
      conditioned his little life bursts upon his parents' horror-stricken gaze.
      Like accomplices in crime, they turn upon and accuse each other&mdash;"sorrow
      makes them wicked and hateful." Allmers, as the one whose eyes were
      already half opened, is the first to carry war into the enemy's country;
      but Rita is not slow to retort, and presently they both have to admit that
      their recriminations are only a vain attempt to drown the voice of
      self-reproach. In a sort of fierce frenzy they tear away veil after veil
      from their souls, until they realise that Eyolf never existed at all, so
      to speak, for his own sake, but only for the sake of their passions and
      vanities. "Isn't it curious," says Rita, summing up the matter, "that we
      should grieve like this over a little stranger boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In blind self-absorption they have played with life and death, and now
      "the great open eyes" of the stranger boy will be for ever upon them.
      Allmers would fain take refuge in a love untainted by the egoism, and
      unexposed to the revulsions, of passion. But not only is Asta's pity for
      Rita too strong to let her countenance this desertion: she has discovered
      that her relation to Allmers is <i>not</i> "exempt from the law of
      change," and she "takes flight from him&mdash;and from herself." Meanwhile
      it appears that the agony which Allmers and Rita have endured in probing
      their wounds has been, as Halvard Solness would say, "salutary
      self-torture." The consuming fire of passion is now quenched, but "it, has
      left an empty place within them," and they feel it common need "to fill it
      up with something that is a little like love." They come to remember that
      there are other children in the world on whom reckless instinct has thrust
      the gift, of life&mdash;neglected children, stunted and maimed in mind if
      not in body. And now that her egoism is seared to the quick, the
      mother-instinct asserts itself in Rita. She will take these children to
      her&mdash;these children to whom her hand and her heart have hitherto been
      closed. They shall be outwardly in Eyolf's place, and perhaps in time they
      may fill the place in her heart that should have been Eyolf's. Thus she
      will try to "make her peace with the great open eyes." For now, at last,
      she has divined the secret of the unwritten book on "human responsibility"
      and has realised that motherhood means&mdash;atonement.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I read this terrible and beautiful work of art. This, I think, is <i>a</i>
      meaning inherent in it&mdash;not perhaps <i>the</i> meaning, and still
      less all the meanings. Indeed, its peculiar fascination for me, among all
      Ibsen's works, lies in the fact that it seems to touch life at so many
      different points. But I must not be understood as implying that Ibsen
      constructed the play with any such definitely allegoric design as is here
      set forth. I do not believe that this creator of men and women ever
      started from an abstract conception. He did not first compose his
      philosophic tune and then set his puppets dancing to it. The germ in his
      mind was dramatic, not ethical; it was only as the drama developed that
      its meanings dawned upon him; and he left them implicit and fragmentary,
      like the symbolism of life itself, seldom formulated, never worked out
      with schematic precision. He simply took a cutting from the tree of life,
      and, planting it in the rich soil of his imagination, let it ramify and
      burgeon as it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if one did not know the date of <i>Little Eyolf</i>, one could
      confidently assign it to the latest period of Ibsen's career, on noting a
      certain difference of scale between its foundations and its
      superstructure. In his earlier plays, down to and including <i>Hedda
      Gabler</i>, we feel his invention at work to the very last moment, often
      with more intensity in the last act than in the first; in his later plays
      he seems to be in haste to pass as early as possible from invention to
      pure analysis. In this play, after the death of Eyolf (surely one of the
      most inspired "situations" in all drama) there is practically no external
      action whatsoever. Nothing happens save in the souls of the characters;
      there is no further invention, but rather what one may perhaps call
      inquisition. This does not prevent the second act from being quite the
      most poignant or the third act from being one of the most moving that
      Ibsen ever wrote. Far from wishing to depreciate the play, I rate it more
      highly, perhaps, than most critics&mdash;among the very greatest of
      Ibsen's achievements. I merely note as a characteristic of the poet's
      latest manner this disparity of scale between the work foreshadowed, so to
      speak, and the work completed. We shall find it still more evident in the
      case of <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i>.

        friends on board? Quite by chance, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Quietly.] No, I did not meet a soul I knew. [Sees the bag.] Why,
        Rita, what have you got there?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Still unpacking.] Alfred's travelling-bag. Don't you recognise
        it?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Joyfully, approaching her.] What! Has Alfred come home?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, only think&mdash;he came quite unexpectedly by the late train
        last night.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, then that was what my feeling meant! It was that that drew me
        out here! And he hadn't written a line to let you know? Not even a
        post-card?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Not a single word.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Did he not even telegraph?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, an hour before he arrived&mdash;quite curtly and coldly.
        [Laughs.] Don't you think that was like him, Asta?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes; he goes so quietly about everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. But that made it all the more delightful to have him again.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, I am sure it would.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. A whole fortnight before I expected him!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. And is he quite well? Not in low spirits?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Closes the bag with a snap, and smiles at her.] He looked quite
        transfigured as he stood in the doorway.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. And was he not the least bit tired either?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, yes, he seemed to be tired enough&mdash;very tired, in fact.
        But, poor fellow, he had come on foot the greater part of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. And then perhaps the high mountain air may have been rather too
        keen for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, no; I don't think so at all. I haven't heard him cough once.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Ah, there you see now! It was a good thing, after all, that the
        doctor talked him into taking this tour.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, now that it is safely over.&mdash;But I can tell you it has
        been a terrible time for me, Asta. I have never cared to talk about it&mdash;and
        you so seldom came out to see me, too&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, I daresay that wasn't very nice of me&mdash;but&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Well, well, well, of course you had your school to attend to in
        town. [Smiling.] And then our road-maker friend&mdash;of course he was
        away too.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, don't talk like that, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Very well, then; we will leave the road-maker out of the question.&mdash;You
        can't think how I have been longing for Alfred! How empty the place
        seemed! How desolate! Ugh, it felt as if there had been a funeral in the
        house!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Why, dear me, only six or seven weeks&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes; but you must remember that Alfred has never been away from me
        before&mdash;never so much as twenty-four hours. Not once in all these
        ten years.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. No; but that is just why I really think it was high time he should
        have a little outing this year. He ought to have gone for a tramp in the
        mountains every summer&mdash;he really ought.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Half smiling.] Oh yes, it's all very well fair you to talk. If I
        were as&mdash;as reasonable its you, I suppose I should have let him go
        before&mdash;perhaps. But I positively could not, Asta! It seemed to me
        I should never get him back again. Surely you can understand that?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. No. But I daresay that is because I have no one to lose.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With a teasing smile.] Really? No one at all?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Not that <i>I</i> know of. [Changing the subject.] But tell me,
        Rita, where is Alfred? Is he still asleep?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, not at all. He got up as early as ever to-day.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Then he can't have been so very tired after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, he was last night&mdash;when he arrived. But now he has had
        little Eyolf with him in his room for a whole hour and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Poor little white-faced boy! Has he to be for ever at his lessons
        again?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With a slight shrug.] Alfred will have it so, you know.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes; but I think you ought to put down your foot about it, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Somewhat impatiently.] Oh no; come now, I really cannot meddle
        with that. Alfred knows so much better about these things than I do. And
        what would you have Eyolf do? He can't run about and play, you see&mdash;like
        other children.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With decision.] I will talk to Alfred about this.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, do; I wish you would.&mdash;Oh! here he is.
      </p>
      <p>
        [ALFRED ALLMERS, dressed in light summer clothes, enters by the door on
        the left, leading EYOLF by the hand. He is a slim, lightly-built man of
        about thirty-six or thirty-seven, with gentle eyes, and thin brown hair
        and beard. His expression is serious and thoughtful. EYOLF wears a suit
        cut like a uniform, with gold braid and gilt military buttons. He is
        lame, and walks with a crutch under his left arm. His leg is shrunken.
        He is undersized, and looks delicate, but has beautiful intelligent
        eyes.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Drops EYOLF's hand, goes up to ASTA with an expression of
        marked pleasure, and holds out both his hands to her.] Asta! My dearest
        Asta! To think of your coming! To think of my seeing you so soon!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. I felt I must&mdash;. Welcome home again!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shaking her hands.] Thank you for coming.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Doesn't he look well?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Gazes fixedly at him.] Splendid! Quite splendid! His eyes are so
        much brighter! And I suppose you have done a great deal of writing on
        your travels? [With an outburst of joy.] I shouldn't wonder if you had
        finished the whole book, Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shrugging his shoulders.] The book? Oh, the book&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, I was sure you would find it go so easily when once you got
        away.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. So I thought too. But, do you know, I didn't find it so at all.
        The truth is, I have not written a line of the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Not a line?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oho! I wondered when I found all the paper lying untouched in your
        bag.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. But, my dear Alfred, what have you been doing all this time?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Smiling.] Only thinking and thinking and thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Putting her arm round his neck.] And thinking a little, too, of
        those you had left at home?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, you may be sure of that. I have thought a great deal of
        you&mdash;every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Taking her arm away.] Ah, that is all I care about.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. But you haven't even touched the book! And yet you can look so
        happy and contented! That is not what you generally do&mdash;I mean when
        your work is going badly.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. You are right there. You see, I have been such a fool hitherto.
        All the best that is in you goes into thinking. What you put on paper is
        worth very little.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Exclaiming.] Worth very little!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Laughing.] What an absurd thing to say, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Looks confidingly up at him.] Oh yes, Papa, what you write is
        worth a great deal!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Smiling and stroking his hair.] Well, well, since you say so.&mdash;But
        I can tell you, some one is coming after me who will do it better.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Who can that be? Oh, tell me!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Only wait&mdash;you may be sure he will come, and let us hear
        of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. And what will you do then?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Seriously.] Then I will go to the mountains again&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Fie, Alfred! For shame!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS.&mdash;up to the peaks and the great waste places.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Papa, don't you think I shall soon be well enough for you to take
        me with you?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With painful emotion.] Oh, yes, perhaps, my little boy.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. It would be so splendid, you know, if I could climb the
        mountains, like you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Changing the subject.] Why, how beautifully you are dressed
        to-day, Eyolf!
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Yes, don't you think so, Auntie?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, indeed. Is it in honour of Papa that you have got your new
        clothes on?
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Yes, I asked Mama to let me. I wanted so to let Papa see me in
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [In a low voice, to RITA.] You shouldn't have given him clothes
        like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [In a low voice.] Oh, he has teased me so long about them&mdash;he
        had set his heart on them. He gave me no peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. And I forgot to tell you, Papa&mdash;Borgheim has bought me a new
        bow. And he has taught me how to shoot with it too.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Ah, there now&mdash;that's just the sort of thing for you,
        Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. And next time he comes, I shall ask him to teach me to swim, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. To swim! Oh, what makes you want to learn swimming?
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Well, you know, all the boys down at the beach can swim. I am the
        only one that can't.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With emotion, taking him in his arms.] You shall learn
        whatever you like&mdash;everything you really want to.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Then do you know what I want most of all, Papa?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No; tell me.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. I want most of all to be a soldier.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Oh, little Eyolf, there are many, many other things that are
        better than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Ah, but when I grow big, then I shall have to be a soldier. You
        know that, don't you?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Clenching his hands together.] Well, well, well: we shall see&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Seating herself at the table on the left.] Eyolf! Come here to
        me, and I will tell you something.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Goes up to her.] What is it, Auntie?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. What do you think, Eyolf&mdash;I have seen the Rat-Wife.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. What! Seen the Rat-Wife! Oh, you're only making a fool of me!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. No; it's quite true. I saw her yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Where did you see her?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. I saw her on the road, outside the town.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I saw her, too, somewhere up in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Who is sitting on the sofa.] Perhaps it will be out turn to see
        her next, Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Auntie, isn't it strange that she should be called the Rat-Wife?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, people just give her that name because she wanders round the
        country driving away all the rats.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I have heard that her real name is Varg.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Varg! That means a wolf, doesn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Patting him on the head.] So you know that, do you?
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Cautiously.] Then perhaps it may be true, after all, that she is
        a were-wolf at night. Do you believe that, Papa?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Oh, no; I don't believe it. Now you ought to go and play a
        little in the garden.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Should I not take some books with me?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, no books after this. You had better go down to the beach to
        the other boys.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Shyly.] No, Papa, I won't go down to the boys to-day.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Why not?
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Oh, because I have these clothes on.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Knitting his brows.] Do you mean that they make fun of&mdash;of
        your pretty clothes?
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Evasively.] No, they daren't&mdash;for then I would thrash them.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Aha!&mdash;then why&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. You see, they are so naughty, these boys. And then they say I can
        never be a soldier.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With suppressed indignation.] Why do they say that, do you
        think?
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. I suppose they are jealous of me. For you know, Papa, they are so
        poor, they have to go about barefoot.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Softly, with choking voice.] Oh, Rita&mdash;how it wrings my
        heart!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Soothingly, rising.] There, there, there!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Threateningly.] But these rascals shall soon find out who is
        the master down at the beach!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Listening.] There is some one knocking.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Oh, I'm sure it's Borgheim!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Come in.
      </p>
      <p>
        [The RAT-WIFE comes softly and noiselessly in by the door on the right.
        She is a thin little shrunken figure, old and grey-haired, with keen,
        piercing eyes, dressed in an old-fashioned flowered gown, with a black
        hood and cloak. She has in her hand a large red umbrella, and carries a
        black bag by a loop over her arm.]
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Softly, taking hold of ASTA's dress.] Auntie! That must surely
        be her!
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. [Curtseying at the door.] I humbly beg pardon&mdash;but
        are your worships troubled with any gnawing things in the house?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Here? No, I don't think so.
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. For it would be such a pleasure to me to rid your
        worships' house of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, yes; we understand. But we have nothing of the sort here.
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. That's very unlucky, that is; for I just happened to be on
        my rounds now, and goodness knows when I may be in these parts again.&mdash;Oh,
        how tired I am!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Pointing to a chair.] Yes, you look tired.
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. I know one ought never to get tired of doing good to the
        poor little things that are hated and persecuted so cruelly. But it
        takes your strength out of you, it does.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Won't you sit down and rest a little?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. I thank your ladyship with all my heart. [Seats herself on
        a chair between the door and the sofa.] I have been out all night at my
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Have you indeed?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. Yes, over on the islands. [With a chuckling laugh.] The
        people sent for me, I can assure you. They didn't like it a bit; but
        there was nothing else to be done. They had to put a good face on it,
        and bite the sour apple. [Looks at EYOLF, and nods.] The sour apple,
        little master, the sour apple.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Involuntarily, a little timidly.] Why did they have to&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. What?
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. To bite it?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. Why, because they couldn't keep body and soul together on
        account of the rats and all the little rat-children, you see, young
        master.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Ugh! Poor people! Have they so many of them?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. Yes, it was all alive and swarming with them. [Laughs with
        quiet glee.] They came creepy-crawly up into the beds all night long.
        They plumped into the milk-cans, and they went pittering and pattering
        all over the floor, backwards and forwards, and up and down.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Softly, to ASTA.] I shall never go there, Auntie.
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. But then I came&mdash;I, and another along with me. And we
        took them with us, every one&mdash;the sweet little creatures! We made
        an end of every one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [With a shriek.] Papa&mdash;look! look!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Good Heavens, Eyolf!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. What's the matter?
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Pointing.] There's something wriggling in the bag!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [At the extreme left, shrieks.] Ugh! Send her away, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. [Laughing.] Oh, dearest lady, you needn't be frightened of
        such a little mannikin.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. But what is the thing?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. Why, it's only little Mopsëman. [Loosening the string of
        the bag.] Come up out of the dark, my own little darling friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        [A little dog with a broad black snout pokes its head out of the bag.]
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. [Nodding and beckoning to EYOLF.] Come along, don't be
        afraid, my little wounded warrior! He won't bite. Come here! Come here!
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Clinging to ASTA.] No, I dare not.
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. Don't you think he has a gentle, lovable countenance, my
        young master?
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Astonished, pointing.] That thing there?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. Yes, this thing here.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Almost under his breath, staring fixedly at the dog.] I think he
        has the horriblest&mdash;countenance I ever saw.
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. [Closing the bag.] Oh, it will come&mdash;it will come,
        right enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Involuntarily drawing nearer, at last goes right up to her, and
        strokes the bag.] But he is lovely&mdash;lovely all the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. [In a tone of caution.] But now he is so tired and weary,
        poor thing. He's utterly tired out, he is. [Looks at ALLMERS.] For it
        takes the strength out of you, that sort of game, I can tell you, sir.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. What sort of game do you mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. The luring game.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Do you mean that it is the dog that lures the rats?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. [Nodding.] Mopsëman and I&mdash;we two do it together. And
        it goes so smoothly&mdash;for all you can see, at any rate. I just slip
        a string through his collar, and then I lead him three times round the
        house, and play on my Pan's-pipes. When they hear that, they have got to
        come up from the cellars, and down from the garrets, and out of flour
        boles, all the blessed little creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. And does he bite them to death then?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. Oh, not at all! No, we go down to the boat, he and I do&mdash;and
        then they follow after us, both the big ones and the little ratikins.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Eagerly.] And what then&mdash;tell me!
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. Then we push out from the land, and I scull with one oar,
        and play on my Pan's-pipes. And Mopsëman, he swims behind. [With
        glittering eyes.] And all the creepers and crawlers, they follow and
        follow us out into the deep, deep waters. Ay, for they have to.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Why do they have to?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. Just because they want not to&mdash;just because they are
        so deadly afraid of the water. That is why they have got to plunge into
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. Are they drowned, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. Every blessed one. [More softly.] And there it is all as
        still, and soft, and dark as their hearts can desire, the lovely little
        things. Down there they sleep a long, sweet sleep, with no one to hate
        them or persecute them any more. [Rises.] In the old days, I can tell
        you, I didn't need any Mopsëman. Then I did the luring myself&mdash;I
        alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. And what did you lure then?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. Men. One most of all.
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [With eagerness.] Oh, who was that one? Tell me!
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. [Laughing.] It was my own sweetheart, it was, little
        heart-breaker!
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. And where is he now, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. [Harshly.] Down where all the rats are. [Resuming her
        milder tone.] But now I must be off and get to business again. Always on
        the move. [To RITA.] So your ladyship has no sort of use for me to-day?
        I could finish it all off while I am about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No, thank you; I don't think we require anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        THE RAT-WIFE. Well, well, your sweet ladyship, you can never tell. If
        your ladyship should find that there is anything lure that keeps
        nibbling and gnawing, and creeping and crawling, then just see and get
        hold of me and Mopsëman.&mdash;Good-bye, good-bye, a kind good-bye to
        you all. [She goes out by the door on the right.]
      </p>
      <p>
        EYOLF. [Softly and triumphantly, to ASTA.] Only think, Auntie, now I
        have seen the Rat-Wife too!
      </p>
      <p>
        [RITA goes out upon the verandah, and fans herself with her
        pocket-handkerchief. Shortly afterwards, EYOLF slips cautiously and
        unnoticed out to the right.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Takes up the portfolio from the table by the sofa.] Is this
        your portfolio, Asta?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes. I have some of the old letters in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Ah, the family letters&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. You know you asked me to arrange them for you while you were away.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Pats her on the head.] And you have actually found time to do
        that, dear?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, yes. I have done it partly out here and partly at my own rooms
        in town.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Thanks, dear. Did you find anything particular in them?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Lightly.] Oh, you know you always find something or other in such
        old papers. [Speaking lower and seriously.] It is the letters to mother
        that are in this portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Those, of course, you must keep yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With an effort.] No; I am determined that you shall look through
        them, too, Alfred. Some time&mdash;later on in life. I haven't the key
        of the portfolio with me just now.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. It doesn't matter, my dear Asta, for I shall never read your
        mother's letters in any case.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Fixing her eyes on him.] Then some time or other&mdash;some quiet
        evening&mdash;I will tell you a little of what is in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, that will be much better. But do you keep your mother's
        letters&mdash;you haven't so many mementos of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        [He hands ASTA the portfolio. She takes it, and lays it on the chair
        under her outdoor things. RITA comes into the room again.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Ugh! I feel as if that horrible old woman had brought a sort of
        graveyard smell with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, she was rather horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I felt almost sick while she was in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. However, I can very well understand the sort of spellbound
        fascination that she talked about. The loneliness of the mountain-peaks
        and of the great waste places has something of the same magic about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looks attentively at him.] What is it that has happened to you,
        Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Smiling.] To me?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, something has happened&mdash;something seems almost to have
        transformed you. Rita noticed it too.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, I saw it the moment you came. A change for the better, I
        hope, Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. It ought to be for the better. And it must and shall come to
        good.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With an outburst.] You have had some adventure on your journey!
        Don't deny it! I can see it in your face!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] No adventure in the world&mdash;outwardly
        at least. But&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Eagerly.] But&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. It is true that within me there has been something of a
        revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh Heavens&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Soothingly, patting her hand.] Only for the better, my dear
        Rita. You may be perfectly certain of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Seats herself on the sofa.] You must tell us all about it, at
        once&mdash;tell us everything!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Turning to ASTA.] Yes, let us sit down, too, Asta. Then I will
        try to tell you as well as I can.
      </p>
      <p>
        [He seats himself on the sofa at RITA's side. ASTA moves a chair
        forward, and places herself near him.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looking at him expectantly.] Well&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Gazing straight before him.] When I look back over my life&mdash;and
        my fortunes&mdash;for the last ten or eleven years, it seems to me
        almost like a fairy-tale or a dream. Don't you think so too, Asta?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, in many ways I think so.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Continuing.] When I remember what we two used to be, Asta&mdash;we
        two poor orphan children&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Impatiently.] Oh, that is such an old, old story.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Not listening to her.] And now here I am in comfort and
        luxury. I have been able to follow my vocation. I have been able to work
        and study&mdash;just as I had always longed to. [Holds out his hand.]
        And all this great&mdash;this fabulous good fortune we owe to you, my
        dearest Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Half playfully, half angrily, slaps his hand.] Oh, I do wish you
        would stop talking like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I speak of it only as a sort of introduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Then do skip the introduction!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Rita,&mdash;you must not think it was the doctor's advice that
        drove me up to the mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Was it not, Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. What was it, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. It was this: I found there was no more peace for me, there in
        my study.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No peace! Why, who disturbed you?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] No one from without. But I felt as though I
        were positively abusing&mdash;or, say rather, wasting&mdash;my best
        powers&mdash;frittering away the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With wide eyes.] When you were writing at your book?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Nodding.] For I cannot think that my powers are confined to
        that alone. I must surely have it in me to do one or two other things as
        well.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Was that what you sat there brooding over?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, mainly that.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. And so that is what has made you so discontented with yourself of
        late; and with the rest of us as well. For you know you were
        discontented, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Gazing straight before him.] There I sat bent over my table,
        day after day, and often half the night too&mdash;writing and writing at
        the great thick book on "Human Responsibility." H'm!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Laying her hand upon his arm.] But, Alfred&mdash;that book is to
        be your life-work.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, you have said so often enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I thought so. Ever since I grew up, I have thought so. [With an
        affectionate expression in his eyes.] And it was you that enabled me to
        devote myself to it, my dear Rita&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, nonsense!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Smiling to her.]&mdash;you, with your gold, and your green
        forests&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Half laughing, half vexed.] If you begin all that rubbish again,
        I shall beat you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looking sorrowfully at him.] But the book, Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. It began, as it were, to drift away from me. But I was more and
        more beset by the thought of the higher duties that laid their claims
        upon me.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Beaming, seizes his hand.] Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. The thought of Eyolf, my dear Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Disappointed, drops his hand.] Ah&mdash;of Eyolf!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Poor little Eyolf has taken deeper and deeper hold of me. After
        that unlucky fall from the table&mdash;and especially since we have been
        assured that the injury is incurable&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Insistently.] But you take all the care you possibly can of him,
        Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. As a schoolmaster, yes; but not as a father. And it is a father
        that I want henceforth to be to Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looking at him and shaking her head.] I don't think I quite
        understand you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I mean that I will try with all my might to make his misfortune
        as painless and easy to him as it can possibly be.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, but, dear&mdash;thank Heaven, I don't think he feels it so
        deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With emotion.] Yes, Rita, he does.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, you may be sure he feels it deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Impatiently.] But, Alfred, what more can you do for him?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I will try to perfect all the rich possibilities that are
        dawning in his childish soul. I will foster all the germs of good in his
        nature&mdash;make them blossom and bear fruit. [With more and more
        warmth, rising.] And I will do more than that! I will help him to bring
        his desires into harmony with what lies attainable before him. That is
        just what at present they are not. All his longings are for things that
        must for ever remain unattainable to him. But I will create a conscious
        happiness in his mind. [He goes once or twice up and down the room. ASTA
        and RITA follow him with their eyes.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. You should take these things more quietly, Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Stops beside the table on the left, and looks at them.] Eyolf
        shall carry on my life-work&mdash;if he wants to. Or he shall choose one
        that is altogether his own. Perhaps that would be best. At all events, I
        shall let mine rest as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Rising.] But, Alfred dear, can you not work both for yourself and
        for Eyolf?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, I cannot. It is impossible! I cannot divide myself in this
        matter&mdash;and therefore I efface myself. Eyolf shall be the complete
        man of our race. And it shall be my new life-work to make him the
        complete man.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Has risen and now goes up to him.] This must have cost you a
        terribly hard struggle, Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, it has. At home here, I should never have conquered
        myself, never brought myself to the point of renunciation. Never at
        home!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Then that was why you went away this summer?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With shining eyes.] Yes! I went up into the infinite
        solitudes. I saw the sunrise gleaming on the mountain peaks. I felt
        myself nearer the stars&mdash;I seemed almost to be in sympathy and
        communion with them. And then I found the strength for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looking sadly at him.] But you will never write any more of your
        book on "Human Responsibility"?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, never, Asta. I tell you I cannot split up my life between
        two vocations. But I will act out my "human responsibility"&mdash;in my
        own life.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With a smile.] Do you think you can live up to such high resolves
        at home here?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Taking her hand.] With you to help me, I can. [Holds out the
        other hand.] And with you too, Asta.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Drawing her hand away.] Ah&mdash;with both of us! So, after all,
        you can divide yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Why, my dearest Rita&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        [RITA moves away from him and stands in the garden doorway. A light and
        rapid knock is heard at the door on the right. Engineer BORGHEIM enters
        quickly. He is a young man of a little over thirty. His expression is
        bright and cheerful, and he holds himself erect.]
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Good morning, Mrs. Allmers. [Stops with an expression of
        pleasure on seeing ALLMERS.] Why, what's this? Home again already, Mr.
        Allmers?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shaking hands with him.] Yes, I arrived list night.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Gaily.] His leave was up, Mr. Borgheim.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, you know it wasn't, Rita&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Approaching.] Oh yes, but it was, though. His furlough had run
        out.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. I see you hold your husband well in hand, Mrs. Allmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I hold to my rights. And besides, everything must have an end.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Oh, not everything&mdash;I hope. Good morning, Miss Allmers!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Holding aloof from him.] Good morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looking at BORGHEIM.] Not everything, you say?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Oh, I am firmly convinced that there are some things in the
        world that will never come to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I suppose you are thinking of love&mdash;and that sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Warmly.] I am thinking of all that is lovely!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. And that never comes to an end. Yes, let us think of that, hope
        for that, all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Coming up to them.] I suppose you will soon have finished your
        road-work out here?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. I have finished it already&mdash;finished it yesterday. It has
        been a long business, but, thank Heaven, that has come to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. And you are beaming with joy over that?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Yes, I am indeed!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Well, I must say&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. What, Mrs. Allmers?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I don't think it is particularly nice of you, Mr. Borgheim.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Indeed! Why not?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Well, I suppose we sha'n't often see you in these parts after
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. No, that is true. I hadn't thought of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh well, I suppose you will be able to look in upon us now and
        then all the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. No, unfortunately that will be out of my power for a very long
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Indeed! How so?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. The fact is, I have got a big piece of new work that I must
        set about at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Have you indeed?&mdash;[Pressing his hand.]&mdash;I am heartily
        glad to hear it.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I congratulate you, Mr. Borgheim!
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Hush, hush&mdash;I really ought not to talk openly of it as
        yet! But I can't help coming out with it! It is a great piece of
        road-making&mdash;up in the north&mdash;with mountain ranges to cross,
        and the most tremendous difficulties to overcome!&mdash;[With an
        outburst of gladness.]&mdash;Oh, what a glorious world this is&mdash;and
        what a joy it is to be a road-maker in it!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Smiling, and looking teasingly at him.] Is it road-making
        business that has brought you out here to-day in such wild spirits?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. No, not that alone. I am thinking of all the bright and
        hopeful prospects that are opening out before me.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Aha, then perhaps you have something still more exquisite in
        reserve!
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Glancing towards ASTA.] Who knows! When once happiness comes
        to us, it is apt to come like it spring flood. [Turns to ASTA.] Miss
        Allmers, would you not like to take a little walk with me? As we used
        to?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Quickly.] No&mdash;no, thank you. Not now. Not to-day.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Oh, do come! Only a little bit of a walk! I have so much I
        want to talk to you about before I go.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Something else, perhaps, that you must not talk openly about as
        yet?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. H'm, that depends&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. But there is nothing to prevent your whispering, you know. [Half
        aside.] Asta, you must really go with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. But, my dear Rita&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Imploringly.] Miss Asta&mdash;remember it is to be a farewell
        walk&mdash;the last for many a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Takes her hat and parasol.] Very well, suppose we take a stroll
        in the garden, then.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Oh, thank you, thank you!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. And while you are there you can see what Eyolf is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Ah, Eyolf, by the bye! Where is Eyolf to-day? I've got
        something for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. He is out playing somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Is he really! Then he has begun to play now? He used always to
        be sitting indoors over his books.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. There is to be an end of that now. I am going to make a regular
        open-air boy of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Ah, now, that's right! Out into the open air with him, poor
        little fellow! Good Lord, what can we possibly do better than play in
        this blessed world? For my part, I think all life is one long playtime!&mdash;Come,
        Miss Asta!
      </p>
      <p>
        [BORGHEIM and ASTA go out on the verandah and down through the garden.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Stands looking after them.] Rita&mdash;do you think there is
        anything between those two?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I don't know what to say. I used to think there was. But Asta has
        grown so strange to me&mdash;so utterly incomprehensible of late.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Indeed! Has she? While I have been away?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, within the last week or two.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. And you think she doesn't care very much about him now?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Not, seriously; not utterly and entirely; not unreservedly&mdash;I
        am sure she doesn't. [Looks searchingly at him.] Would it displease you
        if she did?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. It would not exactly displease me. But it would certainly be a
        disquieting thought&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Disquieting?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes; you must remember that I am responsible for Asta&mdash;for
        her life's happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, come&mdash;responsible! Surely Asta has come to years of
        discretion? I should say she was capable of choosing for herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, we must hope so, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. For my part, I don't think at all ill of Borgheim.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, dear&mdash;no more do I&mdash;quite the contrary. But all
        the same&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Continuing.] And I should be very glad indeed if he and Asta were
        to make a match of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Annoyed.] Oh, why should you be?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With increasing excitement.] Why, for then she would have to go
        far, far away with him! Anal she could never come out here to us, as she
        does now.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Stares at her in astonishment.] What! Can you really wish Asta
        to go away?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, yes, Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Why in all the world&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Throwing her arms passionately round his neck.] For then, at
        last, I should have you to myself alone! And yet&mdash;not even then!
        Not wholly to myself! [Bursts into convulsive weeping.] Oh, Alfred,
        Alfred&mdash;I cannot give you up!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Gently releasing himself.] My dearest Rita, do be reasonable!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I don't care a bit about being reasonable! I care only for you!
        Only for you in all the world! [Again throwing her arms round his neck.]
        For you, for you, for you!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Let me go, let me go&mdash;you are strangling me!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Letting him go.] How I wish I could! [Looking at him with
        flashing eyes.] Oh, if you knew how I have hated you&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Hated me&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes&mdash;when you shut yourself up in your room and brooded over
        your work&mdash;till long, long into the night. [Plaintively.] So long,
        so late, Alfred. Oh, how I hated your work!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. But now I have done with that.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With a cutting laugh.] Oh yes! Now you have given yourself up to
        something worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shocked.] Worse! Do you call our child something worse?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Vehemently.] Yes, I do. As he comes between you and me, I call
        him so. For the book&mdash;the book was not a living being, as the child
        is. [With increasing impetuosity.] But I won't endure it, Alfred! I will
        not endure it&mdash;I tell you so plainly!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looks steadily at her, and says in a low voice.] I am often
        almost afraid of you, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Gloomily.] I am often afraid of myself. And for that very reason
        you must not awake the evil in me.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Why, good Heavens, do I do that?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, you do&mdash;when you tear to shreds the holiest bonds
        between us.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Urgently.] Think what you're saying, Rita. It is your own
        child&mdash;our only child, that you are speaking of.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. The child is only half mine. [With another outburst.] But you
        shall be mine alone! You shall be wholly mine! That I have a right to
        demand of you!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shrugging his shoulders.] Oh, my dear Rita, it is of no use
        demanding anything. Everything must be freely given.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looks anxiously at him.] And that you cannot do henceforth?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, I cannot. I must divide myself between Eyolf and you.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. But if Eyolf had never been born? What then?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Evasively.] Oh, that would be another matter. Then I should
        have only you to care for.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Softly, her voice quivering.] Then I wish he had never been born.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Flashing out.] Rita! You don't know what you are saying!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Trembling with emotion.] It was in pain unspeakable that I
        brought him into the world. But I bore it all with joy and rapture for
        your sake.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Warmly.] Oh yes, I know, I know.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With decision.] But there it must end. I will live my life&mdash;together
        with you&mdash;wholly with you. I cannot go on being only Eyolf's mother&mdash;only
        his mother and nothing more. I will not, I tell you! I cannot! I will be
        all in all to you! To you, Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. But that is just what you are, Rita. Through our child&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh&mdash;vapid, nauseous phrases&mdash;nothing else! No, Alfred, I
        am not to be put off like that. I was fitted to become the child's
        mother, but not to be a mother to him. You must take me as I am, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. And yet you used to be so fond of Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I was so sorry for him&mdash;because you troubled yourself so
        little about him. You kept him reading and grinding at books. You
        scarcely even saw him.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Nodding slowly.] No; I was blind. The time had not yet come
        for me&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looking in his face.] But now, I suppose, it has come?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, at, last. Now I see that the highest task I can have in
        the world is to be a true father to Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. And to me?&mdash;what will you be to me?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Gently.] I will always go on caring for you&mdash;with calm,
        deep tenderness. [ He tries to take her hands.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Evading him.] I don't care a bit for your calm, deep tenderness.
        I want you utterly and entirely&mdash;and alone! Just as I had you in
        the first rich, beautiful days. [Vehemently and harshly.] Never, never
        will I consent to be put off with scraps and leavings, Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [In a conciliatory tone.] I should have thought there was
        happiness in plenty for all three of us, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Scornfully.] Then you are easy to please. [Seats herself at the
        table on the left.] Now listen to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Approaching.] Well, what is it?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looking up at him with a veiled glow in her eyes.] When I got
        your telegram yesterday evening&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes? What then?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA.&mdash;then I dressed myself in white&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, I noticed you were in white when I arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I had let down my hair&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Your sweet masses of hair&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA.&mdash;so that it flowed down my neck and shoulders&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I saw it, I saw it. Oh, how lovely you were, Rita!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. There were rose-tinted shades over both the lamps. And we were
        alone, we two&mdash;the only waking beings in the whole house. And there
        was champagne on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I did not drink any of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looking bitterly at him.] No, that is true. [Laughs harshly.]
        "There stood the champagne, but you tasted it not"&mdash;as the poet
        says.
      </p>
      <p>
        [She rises from the armchair, goes with an air of weariness over to the
        sofa, and seats herself, half reclining, upon it.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Crosses the room and stands before her.] I was so taken up
        with serious thoughts. I had made up my mind to talk to you of our
        future, Rita&mdash;and first and foremost of Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Smiling.] And so you did&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, I had not time to&mdash;for you began to undress.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, and meanwhile you talked about Eyolf. Don't you remember? You
        wanted to know all about little Eyolf's digestion.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking reproachfully at her.] Rita&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. And then you got into your bed, and slept the sleep of the just.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] Rita&mdash;Rita!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Lying at full length and looking up at him.] Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. "There stood your champagne, but you tasted it not."
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Almost harshly.] No. I did not taste it.
      </p>
      <p>
        [He goes away from her and stands in the garden doorway. RITA lies for
        some time motionless, with closed eyes.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Suddenly springing up.] But let me tell you one thing, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Turning in the doorway.] Well?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. You ought not to feel quite so secure as you do!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Not secure?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No, you ought not to be so indifferent! Not certain of your
        property in me!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Drawing nearer.] What do you mean by that?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With trembling lips.] Never in a single thought have I been
        untrue to you, Alfred! Never for an instant.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, Rita, I know that&mdash;I, who know you so well.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With sparkling eyes.] But if you disdain me&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Disdain! I don't understand what you mean!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, you don't know all that might rise up within me, if&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. If?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. If I should ever see that you did not care for me&mdash;that you
        did not love me as you used to.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. But, my dearest Rita&mdash;years bring a certain change with
        them&mdash;and that must one day occur even in us&mdash;as in every one
        else.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Never in me! And I will not hear of any change in you either&mdash;I
        could not bear it, Alfred. I want to keep you to myself alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking at her with concern.] You have a terribly jealous
        nature&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I can't make myself different from what I am. [Threateningly.] If
        you go and divide yourself between me and any one else&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. What then&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Then I will take my revenge on you, Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. How "take your revenge"?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I don't know how.&mdash;Oh yes, I do know, well enough!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I will go and throw myself away&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Throw yourself away, do you say?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, that I will. I'll throw myself straight into the arms of of
        the first man that comes in my way&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking tenderly at her and shaking his head.] That you will
        never do&mdash;my loyal, proud, true-hearted Rita!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Putting her arms round his neck.] Oh, you don't know what I might
        come to be if you&mdash;if you did not love me any more.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Did not love you, Rita? How can you say such a thing!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Half laughing, lets him go.] Why should I not spread my nets for
        that&mdash;that road-maker man that hangs about here?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Relieved.] Oh, thank goodness&mdash;you are only joking.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Not at all. He would do as well as any one else.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Ah, but I suspect he is more or less taken up already.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. So much the better! For then I should take him away from some one
        else; and that is just what Eyolf has done to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Can you say that our little Eyolf has done that?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Pointing with her forefinger.] There, you see! You see! The
        moment you mention Eyolf's name, you grow tender and your voice quivers!
        [Threateningly, clenching her hands.] Oh, you almost tempt we to wish&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking at her anxiously.] What do I tempt you to wish, Rita?&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Vehemently, going away from him.] No, no, no&mdash;I won't tell
        you that! Never!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Drawing nearer to her.] Rita! I implore you&mdash;for my sake
        and for your own&mdash;do not let yourself he tempted into evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        [BORGHEIM and ASTA come up from the garden. They both show signs of
        restrained emotion. They look serious and dejected. ASTA remains out on
        the verandah. BORGHEIM comes into the room.]
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. So that is over&mdash;Miss Allmers and I have had our last
        walk together.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looks at him with surprise.] Ah! And there is no longer journey
        to follow the walk?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Yes, for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. For you alone?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Yes, for me alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Glances darkly at ALLMERS.] Do you hear that? [Turns to
        BORGHEIM.] I'll wager it is some one with the evil eye that has played
        you this trick.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Looks at her.] The evil eye?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Nodding.] Yes, the evil eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Do you believe in the evil eye, Mrs. Allmers?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes. I have begun to believe in the evil eye. Especially in a
        child's evil eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shocked, whispers.] Rita&mdash;how can you&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Speaking low.] It is you that make me so wicked and hateful,
        Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Confused cries and shrieks are heard in the distance, from the
        direction of the fiord.]
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Going to the glass door.] What noise is that?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [In the doorway.] Look at all those people running down to the
        pier!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. What can it be? [Looks out for a moment.] No doubt it's those
        street urchins at some mischief again.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Calls, leaning over the verandah railings.] I say, you boys
        down there! What's the matter?
      </p>
      <p>
        [Several voices are heard answering indistinctly and confusedly.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. What do they say?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. They say it's a child that's drowned.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. A child drowned?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Uneasily.] A little boy, they say.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Oh, they can all swim, every one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Shrieks in terror.] Where is Eyolf?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Keep quiet&mdash;quiet. Eyolf is down in the garden, playing.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. No, he wasn't in the garden.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With upstretched arms.] Oh, if only it isn't he!
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Listens, and calls down.] Whose child is it, do you say?
      </p>
      <p>
        [Indistinct voices are heard. BORGHEIM and ASTA utter a suppressed cry,
        and rush out through the garden.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [In an agony of dread.] It isn't Eyolf! It isn't Eyolf, Rita!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [On the verandah, listening.] Hush! Be quiet! Let me hear what
        they are saying!
      </p>
      <p>
        [RITA rushes back with a piercing shriek, into the room.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Following her.] What did they say?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Sinking down beside the armchair on the left.] They said: "The
        crutch is floating!"
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Almost paralysed.] No! No! No!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Hoarsely.] Eyolf! Eyolf! Oh, but they must save him!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Half distracted.] They must, they must! So precious a life!
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        [A little narrow glen by the side of the fiord, on ALLMERS'S property.
        On the left, lofty old trees overarch the spot. Down the slope in the
        background a brook comes leaping, and loses itself among the stones on
        the margin of the wood. A path winds along by the brook-side. To the
        right there are only a few single trees, between which the fiord is
        visible. In front is seen the corner of a boat-shed with a boat drawn
        up. Under the old trees on the left stands a table with a bench and one
        or two chairs, all made of thin birch-staves. It is a heavy, damp day,
        with driving mist wreaths.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [ALFRED ALLMERS, dressed as before, sits on the bench, leaning his arms
        on the table. His hat lies before him. He gazes absently and immovably
        out over the water.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Presently ASTA ALLMERS comes down the woodpath. She is carrying an open
        umbrella.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Goes quietly and cautiously up to him.] You ought not to sit down
        here in this gloomy weather, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Nods slowly without answering.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Closing her umbrella.] I have been searching for you such a long
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Without expression.] Thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Moves a chair and seats herself close to him.] Have you been
        sitting here long? All the time?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Does not answer at first. Presently he says.] No, I cannot
        grasp it. It seems so utterly impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Laying her hand compassionately on his arm.] Poor Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Gazing at her.] Is it really true then, Asta? Or have I gone
        mad? Or am I only dreaming? Oh, if it were only a dream! Just think, if
        I were to waken now!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, if I could only waken you!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking out over the water.] How pitiless the fiord looks
        to-day, lying so heavy and drowsy&mdash;leaden-grey&mdash;with splashes
        of yellow&mdash;and reflecting the rain-clouds.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Imploringly.] Oh, Alfred, don't sit staring out over the fiord!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Not heeding her.] Over the surface, yes. But in the depths&mdash;there
        sweeps the rushing undertow&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [In terror.] Oh, for God's sake don't think of the depths!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking gently at her.] I suppose you think he is lying close
        outside here? But he is not, Asta. You must not think that. You must
        remember how fiercely the current sweeps gut here straight to the open
        sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Throws herself forward against the table, and, sobbing, buries
        her face in her hands.] Oh, God! Oh, God!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Heavily.] So you see, little Eyolf has passed so far&mdash;far
        away from us now.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looks imploringly up at him.] Oh, Alfred, don't say such things!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Why, you can reckon it out for yourself&mdash;you that are so
        clever. In eight-and-twenty hours&mdash;nine-and-twenty hours&mdash;Let
        me see&mdash;! Let me see&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Shrieking and stopping her ears.] Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Clenching his hand firmly upon the table.] Can you conceive
        the meaning of a thing like this?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looks at him.] Of what?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Of this that has been done to Rita and me.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. The meaning of it?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Impatiently.] Yes, the meaning, I say. For, after all, there
        must be a meaning in it. Life, existence&mdash;destiny, cannot be so
        utterly meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, who can say anything with certainty about these things, my
        dear Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Laughs bitterly.] No, no; I believe you are right there.
        Perhaps the whole thing goes simply by hap-hazard&mdash;taking its own
        course, like a drifting wreck without a rudder. I daresay that is how it
        is. At least, it seems very like it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Thoughtfully.] What if it only seems&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Vehemently.] Ah? Perhaps you can unravel the mystery for me? I
        certainly cannot. [More gently.] Here is Eyolf, just entering upon
        conscious life: full of such infinite possibilities&mdash;splendid
        possibilities perhaps: he would have filled my life with pride and
        gladness. And then a crazy old woman has only to come this way&mdash;and
        show a cur in a bag&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. But we don't in the least know how it really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, we do. The boys saw her row out over the fiord. They saw
        Eyolf standing alone at the very end of the pier. They saw him gazing
        after her&mdash;and then he seemed to turn giddy. [Quivering.] And that
        was how he fell over&mdash;and disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, yes. But all the same&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. She has drawn him down into the depths&mdash;that you may be
        sure of, dear.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. But, Alfred, why should she?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, that is just the question! Why should she? There is no
        retribution behind it all&mdash;no atonement, I mean. Eyolf never did
        her any harm. He never called names after her; he never threw stones at
        her dog. Why, he had never set eyes either on her or her dog till
        yesterday. So there is no retribution; the whole thing is utterly
        groundless and meaningless, Asta.&mdash;And yet the order of the world
        requires it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Have you spoken to Rita of these things?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shakes his head.] I feel as if I can talk better to you about
        them. [Drawing a deep breath.] And about everything else as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        [ASTA takes serving-materials and a little paper parcel out of her
        pocket. ALLMERS sits looking on absently.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. What leave you got there, Asta?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Taking his hat.] Some black crap.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Oh, whet is the use of that?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Rita asked me to put it on. May I?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Oh, yes; as far as I'm concerned&mdash;[She sews the crape on
        his hat.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Sitting and looking at her.] Where is Rita?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. She is walking about the garden a little, I think. Borgheim is
        with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Slightly surprised.] Indeed! Is Borgheim out here to-day
        again?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes. He came out by the mid-day train.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I didn't expect that.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Serving.] He was so fond of Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Borgheim is a faithful soul, Asta.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With quiet warmth.] Yes, faithful he is, indeed. That is certain.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Fixing his eyes upon her.] You are really fond of him?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, I am.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. And yet you cannot make up your mind to&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Interrupting.] Oh, my dear Alfred, don't talk of that!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, yes; tell me why you cannot?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, no! Please! You really must not ask me. You see, it's so
        painful for me.&mdash;There now! The hat is done.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. And now for the left arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Am I to have crape on it too?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, that is the custom.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well&mdash;as you please.
      </p>
      <p>
        [She moves close up to him and begins to sew.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Keep your arm still&mdash;then I won't prick you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With a half-smile.] This is like the old days.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, don't you think so?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. When you were a little girl you used to sit just like this,
        mending my clothes. The first thing you ever sewed for me&mdash;that was
        black crape, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Was it?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Round my student's cap&mdash;at the time of father's death.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Could I sew then? Fancy, I have forgotten it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Oh, you were such a little thing then.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, I was little then.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. And then, two years afterwards&mdash;when we lost your mother&mdash;then
        again you sewed a big crape band on my sleeve.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. I thought it was the right thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Patting her hand.] Yes, yes, it was the right thing to do,
        Asta. And then when we were left alone in the world, we two&mdash;. Are
        you done already?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes. [Putting together her sewing-materials.] It was really a
        beautiful time for us, Alfred. We two alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, it was&mdash;though we had to toil so hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. You toiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With more life.] Oh, you toiled too, in your way, I can assure
        you&mdash;[smiling]&mdash;my dear, faithful&mdash;Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh&mdash;you mustn't remind me of that stupid nonsense about the
        name.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well, if you had been a boy, you would have been called Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, if! But when you began to go to college&mdash;. [Smiling
        involuntarily.] I wonder how you could be so childish.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Was it I that was childish?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, indeed, I think it was, as I look back upon it all. You were
        ashamed of having no brother&mdash;only a sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, no, it was you, dear&mdash;you were ashamed.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh yes, I too, perhaps&mdash;a little. And somehow or other I was
        sorry for you&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, I believe you were. And then you hunted up some of my old
        boy's clothes&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Your fine Sunday clothes&mdash;yes. Do you remember the blue
        blouse and knickerbockers?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [His eyes dwelling upon her.] I remember so well how you looked
        when you used to wear them.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Only when we were at home, alone, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. And how serious we were, dear, and how mightily pleased with
        ourselves. I always called you Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, Alfred, I hope you have never told Rita this?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, I believe I did once tell her.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, Alfred, how could you do that?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well, you see&mdash;one tells one's wife everything&mdash;very
        nearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, I suppose one does.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [As if awakening, clutches at his forehead and starts up.] Oh,
        how can I sit here and&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Rising, looks sorrowfully at him.] What is the matter?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. He had almost passed away from me. He had passed quite away.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Eyolf!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Here I sat, living in these recollections&mdash;and he had no
        part in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, Alfred&mdash;little Eyolf was behind it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, he was not. He slipped out of my memory&mdash;out of my
        thoughts. I did not see him for a moment as we sat here talking. I
        utterly forgot him all that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. But surely you must take some rest in your sorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, no, no; that is just what I will not do! I must not&mdash;I
        have no right&mdash;and no heart for it, either. [Going in great
        excitement towards the right.] All my thoughts must be out there, where
        he lies drifting in the depths!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Following him and holding him back.] Alfred&mdash;Alfred! Don't
        go to the fiord.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I must go out to him! Let me go, Asta! I will take the boat.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [In terror.] Don't go to the fiord, I say!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Yielding.] No, no&mdash;I will not. Only let me alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Leading him back to the table.] You must rest from your thoughts,
        Alfred. Come here and sit down.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Making as if to seat himself on the bench.] Well, well&mdash;as
        you please.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. No, I won't let you sit there.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, let me.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. No, don't. For then you will only sit looking out&mdash;[Forces
        him down upon a chair, with his back to the right.] There now. Now
        that's right. [Seats herself upon the bench.] And now we can talk a
        little again.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Drawing a deep breath audibly.] It was good to deaden the
        sorrow and heartache for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. You insist do so, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. But don't you think it is terribly weak and unfeeling of me&mdash;to
        be able to do so?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, no&mdash;I am sure it is impossible to keep circling for ever
        round one fixed thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, for me it is impossible. Before you came to me, here I
        sat, torturing myself unspeakably with this crushing, gnawing sorrow&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. And would you believe it, Asta&mdash;? H'm&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Well?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. In the midst of all the agony, I found myself speculating what
        we should have for dinner to-day.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Soothingly.] Well, well, if only it rests you to&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, just fancy, dear&mdash;it seemed as if it did give me
        rest. [Holds out, his hand to her across the table.] How good it is,
        Asta, that I have you with me. I am so glad of that. Glad, glad&mdash;even
        in my sorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looking earnestly at him.] You ought most of all to be glad that
        you have Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, of course I should. But Rita is no kin to me&mdash;it
        isn't like having a sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Eagerly.] Do you say that, Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, our family is a thing apart. [Half jestingly.] We have
        always had vowels for our initials. Don't you remember how often we used
        to speak of that? And all our relations&mdash;all equally poor. And we
        have all the same colour of eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Do you think I have&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, you take entirely after your mother. You are not in the
        least like the rest of us&mdash;not even like father. But all the same&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. All the same&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well, I believe that living together has, as it were, stamped
        us in each other's image&mdash;mentally, I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With warm emotion.] Oh, you must never say that, Alfred. It is
        only I that have taken my stamp from you; and it is to you that I owe
        everything&mdash;every good thing in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] You owe me nothing, Asta. On the contrary&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. I owe you everything! You must never doubt that. No sacrifice has
        been too great for you&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Interrupting.] Oh, nonsense&mdash;sacrifice! Don't talk of
        such a thing.&mdash;I have only loved you, Asta, ever since you were a
        little child. [After a short pause.] And then it always seemed to me
        that I had so much injustice to make up to you for.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Astonished.] Injustice? You?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Not precisely on my own account. But&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Eagerly.] But&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. On father's.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Half rising from the bench.] On&mdash;father's! [Sitting down
        again.] What do you mean by that, Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Father was never really kind to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Vehemently.] Oh, don't say that!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, it is true. He did not love you&mdash;not as he ought to
        have.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Evasively.] No, perhaps not as he loved you. That was only
        natural.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Continuing.] And he was often hard to your mother, too&mdash;at
        least in the last years.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Softly.] Mother was so much, much younger than he&mdash;remember
        that.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Do you think they were not quite suited to each other?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Perhaps not.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, but still&mdash;. Father, who in other ways was so gentle
        and warm-hearted&mdash;so kindly towards every one&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Quietly.] Mother, too, was not always as she ought to have been.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Your mother was not!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Perhaps not always.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Towards father, do you mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I never noticed that.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Struggling with her tears, rises.] Oh, my dear Alfred&mdash;let
        them rest&mdash;those who are gone. [She goes towards the right.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Rising.] Yes, let them rest. [Wringing his hands.] But those
        who are gone&mdash;it is they that won't let us rest, Asta. Neither day
        nor night.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looks warmly at him.] Time will make it all seem easier, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking helplessly at her.] Yes, don't you think it will?&mdash;But
        how I am to get over these terrible first days [Hoarsely.]&mdash;that is
        what I cannot imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Imploringly, laying her hands on his shoulders.] Go up to Rita.
        Oh, please do&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Vehemently, withdrawing from her.] No, no, no&mdash;don't talk
        to me of that! I cannot, I tell you. [More calmly.] Let me remain here,
        with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Well, I will not leave you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Seizing her hand and holding it fast.] Thank you for that!
        [Looks out for a time over the fiord.] Where is my little Eyolf now?
        [Smiling sadly to her.] Can you tell me that my big, wise Eyolf?
        [Shaking his head.] No one in all the world can tell me that. I know
        only this one terrible thing&mdash;that he is gone from me.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looking up to the left, and withdrawing her hand.] Here they are
        coming.
      </p>
      <p>
        [MRS. ALLMERS and Engineer BORGHEIM come down by the wood-path, she
        leading the way. She wears a dark dress and a black veil over her head.
        He has an umbrella under his arm.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Going to meet her.] How is it with you, Rita?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Passing him.] Oh, don't ask.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Why do you come here?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Only to look for you. What are you doing?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Nothing. Asta came down to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, but before Asta came? You have been away from me all the
        morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I have been sitting here looking out over the water.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Ugh,&mdash;how can you?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Impatiently.] I like best to be alone now.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Moving restlessly about.] And then to sit still! To stay in one
        place!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I have nothing in the world to move for.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I cannot bear to be anywhere long. Least of all here&mdash;with
        the fiord at my very feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. It is just the nearness of the fiord&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [To BORGHEIM.] Don't you think he should come back with the rest
        of us?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [To ALLMERS.] I believe it would be better for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, no; let me stay where I am.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Then I will stay with you, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Very well; do so, then. You remain too, Asta.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Whispers to BORGHEIM.] Let us leave them alone!
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [With a glance of comprehension.] Miss Allmers, shall we go a
        little further&mdash;along the shore? For the very last time?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Taking her umbrella.] Yes, come. Let us go a little further.
      </p>
      <p>
        [ASTA and BORGHEIM go out together behind the boat-shed. ALLMERS wanders
        about for a little. Then he seats himself on a stone under the trees on
        the left.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Comes up and stands before him, her hands folded and hanging
        down.] Can you think the thought, Alfred&mdash;that we have lost Eyolf?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking sadly at the ground.] We must accustom ourselves to
        think it.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I cannot. I cannot. And then that horrible sight that will haunt
        me all my life long.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking up.] What sight? What have you seen?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I have seen nothing myself. I have only heard it told. Oh&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. You may as well tell me at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I got Borgheim to go down with me to the pier&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. What did you want there?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. To question the boys as to how it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. But we know that.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. We got to know more.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. It is not true that he disappeared all at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Do they say that now?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes. They say they saw him lying down on the bottom. Deep down in
        the clear water.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Grinding his teeth.] And they didn't save him!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I suppose they could not.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. They could swim&mdash;every one of them. Did they tell you how
        he was lying whilst they could see him?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes. They said he was lying on his back. And with great, open
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Open eyes. But quite still?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, quite still. And then something came and swept him away. They
        called it the undertow.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Nodding slowly.] So that was the last they saw of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Suffocated with tears.] Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [In a dull voice.] And never&mdash;never will any one see him
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Wailing.] I shall see him day and night, as he lay down there.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. With great, open eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Shuddering.] Yes, with great, open eyes. I see them! I see them
        now!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Rises slowly and looks with quiet menace at her.] Were they
        evil, those eyes, Rita?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Turning pale.] Evil&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Going close up to her.] Were they evil eyes that stared up? Up
        from the depths?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Shrinking from him.] Alfred&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Following her.] Answer me! Were they a child's evil eyes?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Shrieks.] Alfred! Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Now things have come about&mdash;just as you wished, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I! What did I wish?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. That Eyolf were not here.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Never for a moment have I wished that! That Eyolf should not stand
        between us&mdash;that was what I wished.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well, well&mdash;he does not stand between us any more.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Softly, gazing straight before her.] Perhaps now more than ever.
        [With a sudden shudder.] Oh, that horrible sight!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Nods.] The child's evil eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [In dread, recoiling from him.] Let me be, Alfred! I am afraid of
        you. I have never seen you like this before.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looks harshly and coldly at her.] Sorrow makes us wicked and
        hateful.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Terrified, and yet defiant.] That is what I feel, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        [ALLMERS goes towards the right and looks out over the fiord. RITA seats
        herself at the table. A short pause.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Turning his head towards her.] You never really and truly
        loved him&mdash;never!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With cold self-control.] Eyolf would never let me take him really
        and truly to my heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Because you did not want to.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh yes, I did. I did want to. But some one stood in the way&mdash;even
        from the first.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Turning right round.] Do you mean that <i>I</i> stood in the
        way?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, no&mdash;not at first.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Coming nearer her.] Who, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. His aunt.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Asta?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes. Asta stood and barred the way for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Can you say that, Rita?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes. Asta&mdash;she took him to her heart&mdash;from the moment
        that happened&mdash;that miserable fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. If she did so, she did it in love.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Vehemently.] That is just it! I cannot endure to share anything
        with any one! Not in love.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. We two should have shared him between us in love.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looking scornfully at him.] We? Oh, the truth is you have never
        had any real love for him either.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looks at her in astonishment.] <i>I</i> have not&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No, you have not. At first you were so utterly taken up by that
        book of yours&mdash;about Responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Forcibly.] Yes, I was. But my very book&mdash;I sacrificed for
        Eyolf's sake.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Not out of love for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Why then, do you suppose?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Because you were consumed with mistrust of yourself. Because you
        had begun to doubt whether you had any great vocation to live for in the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Observing her closely.] Could you see that in me?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, yes&mdash;little by little. And then you needed something new
        to fill up your life.&mdash;It seems <i>I</i> was not enough for you any
        longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. That is the law of change, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. And that was why you wanted to make a prodigy of poor little
        Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. That was not what I wanted. I wanted to make a happy human
        being of him.&mdash;That, and nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. But not out of love for him. Look into yourself! [With a certain
        shyness of expression.] Search out all that lies under&mdash;and behind
        your action.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Avoiding her eyes.] There is something you shrink from saying.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. And you too.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looks thoughtfully at her.] If it is as you say, then we two
        have never really possessed our own child.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No. Not in perfect love.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. And yet we are sorrowing so bitterly for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With sarcasm.] Yes, isn't it curious that we should grieve like
        this over a little stranger boy?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With an outburst.] Oh, don't call him a stranger!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Sadly shaking her head.] We never won the boy, Alfred. Not I&mdash;nor
        you either.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Wringing his hands.] And now it is too late! Too late!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. And no consolation anywhere&mdash;in anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With sudden passion.] You are the guilty one in this!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Rising.] I!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, you! It was your fault that he became&mdash;what he was!
        It was your fault that he could not save himself when he fell into the
        water.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With a gesture of repulsion.] Alfred&mdash;you shall not throw
        the blame upon me!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [More and more beside himself.] Yes, yes, I do! It was you that
        left the helpless child unwatched upon the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. He was lying so comfortably among the cushions, and sleeping so
        soundly. And you had promised to look after him.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, I had. [Lowering his voice.] But then you came&mdash;you,
        you, you&mdash;and lured me to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looking defiantly at him.] Oh, better own at once that you forgot
        the child and everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [In suppressed desperation.] Yes, that is true. [Lower.] I
        forgot the child&mdash;in your arms!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Exasperated.] Alfred! Alfred&mdash;this is intolerable of you!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [In a low voice, clenching his fists before her face.] In that
        hour you condemned little Eyolf to death.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Wildly.] You, too! You, too&mdash;if it is as you say!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Oh yes&mdash;call me to account, too&mdash;if you will. We have
        sinned, both of us. And so, after all, there was retribution in Eyolf's
        death.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Retribution?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With more self-control.] Yes. Judgment upon you and me. Now,
        as we stand here, we have our deserts. While he lived, we let ourselves
        shrink away from him in secret, abject remorse. We could not bear to see
        it&mdash;the thing he had to drag with him&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Whispers.] The crutch.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, that. And now, what we now call sorrow and heartache&mdash;is
        really the gnawing of conscience, Rita. Nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Gazing helplessly at him.] I feel as if all this must end in
        despair&mdash;in madness for both of us. For we can never&mdash;never
        make it good again.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Passing into a calmer mood.] I dreamed about Eyolf last night.
        I thought I saw him coming up from the pier. He could run like other
        boys. So nothing had happened to him&mdash;neither the one thing nor the
        other. And the torturing reality was nothing but a dream, I thought. Oh,
        how I thanked and blessed&mdash;[Checking himself.] H'm!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looking at him.] Whom?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Evasively.] Whom&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes; whom did you thank and bless?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Putting aside the question.] I was only dreaming, you know&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. One whom you yourself do not believe in?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. That was how I felt, all the same. Of course, I was sleeping&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Reproachfully.] You should not have taught me to doubt, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Would it leave been right of me to let you go through life with
        your mind full of empty fictions?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. It would have been better for me; for then I should have had
        something to take refuge in. Now I am utterly at sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Observing her closely.] If you had the choice now&mdash;. If
        you could follow Eyolf to where he is&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes? What then?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. If you were fully assured that you would find him again&mdash;know
        him&mdash;understand him&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, yes; what then?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Would you, of your own free will, take the leap over to him? Of
        your own free will leave everything behind you? Renounce your whole
        earthly life? Would you, Rita?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Softly.] Now, at once?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes; to-day. This very hour. Answer me&mdash;would you?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Hesitating.] Oh, I don't know, Alfred. No! I think I should have
        to stay here with you, a little while.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. For my sake?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes. Only for your sake.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. And afterwards? Would you then&mdash;? Answer!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, what can I answer? I could not go away from you. Never! Never!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. But suppose now <i>I</i> went to Eyolf? And you had the fullest
        assurance that you would meet both him and me there. Then would you come
        over to us?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I should want to&mdash;so much! so much! But&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well? I I?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Moaning softly.] I could not&mdash;I feel it. No, no, I never
        could! Not for all the glory of heaven!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Nor I.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No, you feel it so, too, don't you, Alfred! You could not either,
        could you?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No. For it is here, in the life of earth, that we living beings
        are at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, here lies the kind of happiness that we can understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Darkly.] Oh, happiness&mdash;happiness&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. You mean that happiness&mdash;that we can never find it again?
        [Looks inquiringly at him.] But if&mdash;? [Vehemently.] No, no; I dare
        not say it! Nor even think it!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, say it&mdash;say it, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Hesitatingly.] Could we not try to&mdash;? Would it not be
        possible to forget him?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Forget Eyolf?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Forget the anguish and remorse, I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Can you wish it?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes,&mdash;if it were possible. [With an outburst.] For this&mdash;I
        cannot bear this for ever! Oh, can we not think of something that will
        bring its forgetfulness!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shakes his head.] What could that be?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Could we not see what travelling would do&mdash;far away from
        here?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. From home? When you know you are never really well anywhere but
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Well, then, let us have crowds of people about us! Keep open
        house! Plunge into something that can deaden and dull our thoughts!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Such it life would be impossible for me.&mdash;No,&mdash;rather
        than that, I would try to take up my work again.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Bitingly.] Your work&mdash;the work that has always stood like a
        dead wall between us!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Slowly, looking fixedly at her.] There must always be a dead
        wall between us two, from this time forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Why must there&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Who knows but that a child's great, open eyes are watching us
        day and night.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Softly, shuddering.] Alfred&mdash;how terrible to think of!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Our love has been like a consuming fire. Now it must be
        quenched&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With a movement towards him.] Quenched!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Hardly.] It is quenched&mdash;in one of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [As if petrified.] And you dare say that to me!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [More gently.] It is dead, Rita. But in what I now feel for you&mdash;in
        our common guilt and need of atonement&mdash;I seem to foresee a sort of
        resurrection&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Vehemently.] I don't care a bit about any resurrection!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Rita!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I am a warm-blooded being! I don't go drowsing about&mdash;with
        fishes' blood in my veins. [Wringing her hands.] And now to be
        imprisoned for life&mdash;in anguish and remorse! Imprisoned with one
        who is no longer mine, mine, mine!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. It must have ended so, sometime, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Must have ended so! The love that in the beginning rushed forth so
        eagerly to meet with love!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. My love did not rush forth to you in the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. What did you feel for me, first of all?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Dread.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. That I can understand. How was it, then, that I won you after all?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [In a low voice.] You were so entrancingly beautiful, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looks searchingly at him.] Then that was the only reason? Say it,
        Alfred! The only reason?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Conquering himself.] No, there was another as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With an outburst.] I can guess what that was! It was "my gold,
        and my green forests," as you call it. Was it not so, Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looks at him with deep reproach.] How could you&mdash;how could
        you!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I had Asta to think of.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Angrily.] Yes, Asta! [Bitterly.] Then it was really Asta that
        brought us two together?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. She knew nothing about it. She has no suspicion of it, even to
        this day.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Rejecting the plea.] It was Asta, nevertheless! [Smiling, with a
        sidelong glance of scorn. ] Or, no&mdash;it was little Eyolf. Little
        Eyolf, my dear!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Eyolf&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, you used to call her Eyolf, did you not? I seem to remember
        your telling me so&mdash;once, in a moment of confidence. [Coming up to
        him.] Do you remember it&mdash;that entrancingly beautiful hour, Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Recoiling, as if in horror.] I remember nothing! I will not
        remember!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Following him.] It was in that hour&mdash;when your other little
        Eyolf was crippled for life!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [In a hollow voice, supporting himself against the table.]
        Retribution!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Menacingly.] Yes, retribution!
      </p>
      <p>
        [ASTA and BORGHEIM return by way of the boat-shed. She is carrying some
        water-lilies in her hand.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With self-control.] Well, Asta, have you and Mr. Borgheim talked
        things thoroughly over?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, yes&mdash;pretty well.
      </p>
      <p>
        [She puts down her umbrella and lays the flowers upon a chair.]
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Miss Allmers has been very silent during our walk.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Indeed, has she? Well, Alfred and I have talked things out
        thoroughly enough&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looking eagerly at both of them.] What is this&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Enough to last all our lifetime, I say. [Breaking off.] Come now,
        let us go up to the house, all four of us. We must have company about us
        in future. It will never do for Alfred and me to be alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, do you go ahead, you two. [Turning.] I must speak a word
        to you before we go, Asta.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looking at him.] Indeed? Well then, you come with me, Mr.
        Borgheim.
      </p>
      <p>
        [RITA and BORGHEIM go up the wood-path.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Anxiously.] Alfred, what is the matter?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Darkly.] Only that I cannot endure to be here any more.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Here! With Rita, do you mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes. Rita and I cannot go on living together.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Seizes his arm and shakes it.] Oh, Alfred&mdash;don't say
        anything so terrible!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. It is the truth. I am telling you. We are making each other
        wicked and hateful.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With painful emotion.] I had never&mdash;never dreamt of anything
        like this!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I did not realise it either, till to-day.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. And now you want to&mdash;! What is it you really want, Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I want to get away from everything here&mdash;far, far away
        from it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. And to stand quite alone in the world?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Nods.] As I used to, before, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. But you are not fitted for living alone!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Oh, yes. I was so in the old days, at any rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. In the old days, yes; for then you had me with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Trying to take her hand.] Yes. And it is to you, Asta, that I
        now want to come home again.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Eluding him.] To me! No, no, Alfred! That is quite impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looks sadly at her.] Then Borgheim stands in the way after
        all?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Earnestly.] No, no; he does not! That is quite a mistake!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Good. Then I will come to you&mdash;my dear, dear sister. I
        must come to you again&mdash;home to you, to be purified and ennobled
        after my life with&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Shocked.] Alfred,&mdash;you are doing Rita a great wrong!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I have done her a great wrong. But not in this. Oh, think of
        it, Asta&mdash;think of our life together, yours and mine. Was it not
        like one long holy-day from first to last?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, it was, Alfred. But we can never live it over again.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Bitterly.] Do you mean that marriage has so irreparably ruined
        me?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Quietly.] No, that is not what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well, then we two will live our old life over again.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With decision.] We cannot, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, we can. For the love of a brother and sister&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Eagerly.] What of it?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. That is the only relation in life that is not subject to the
        law of change.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Softly and tremblingly.] But if that relation were not&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Not&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA.&mdash;not our relation?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Stares at her in astonishment.] Not ours? Why, what can you
        mean by that?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. It is best I should tell you at once, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, yes; tell me!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. The letters to mother&mdash;. Those in my portfolio&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. You must read them&mdash;when I am gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Why must I?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Struggling with herself.] For then you will see that&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA.&mdash;that I have no right to bear your father's name.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Staggering backwards.] Asta! What is this you say!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Read the letters. Then you will see&mdash;and understand. And
        perhaps have some forgiveness&mdash;for mother, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Clutching at his forehead.] I cannot grasp this&mdash;I cannot
        realise the thought. You, Asta&mdash;you are not&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. You are not my brother, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Quickly, half defiantly, looking at her.] Well, but what
        difference does that really make in our relation? Practically none at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Shaking her head.] It makes all the difference, Alfred. Our
        relation is not that of brother and sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No, no. But it is none the less sacred for that&mdash;it will
        always be equally sacred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Do not forget&mdash;that it is subject to the law of change, as
        you said just now.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looks inquiringly at her.] Do you mean that&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Quietly, but with rearm emotion.] Not a word more&mdash;my dear,
        dear Alfred. [Takes up the flowers from the chair.] Do you see these
        water-lilies?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Nodding slowly.] They are the sort that shoot up&mdash;from
        the very depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. I pulled them in the tarn&mdash;where it flows out into the fiord.
        [Holds them out to him.] Will you take them, Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Taking them.] Thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With tears in her eyes.] They are a last greeting to you, from&mdash;from
        little Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking at her.] From Eyolf out yonder? Or from you?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Softly.] From both of us. [Taking up her umbrella.] Now come with
        me to Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        [She goes up the wood-path.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Takes up his hat from the table, and whispers sadly.] Asta.
        Eyolf. Little Eyolf&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        [He follows her up the path.]

      ACT THIRD

    <div class="play">
      <p>
        [An elevation, overgrown with shrubs, in ALLMERS'S garden. At the back a
        sheer cliff, with a railing along its edge, and with steps on the left
        leading downwards. An extensive view over the fiord, which lies deep
        below. A flagstaff with lines, but no flag, stands by the railing. In
        front, on the right, a summer-house, covered with creepers and wild
        vines. Outside it, a bench. It is a late summer evening, with clear sky.
        Deepening twilight.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [ASTA is sitting on the bench, with her hands in her lap. She is wearing
        her outdoor dress and a hat, has her parasol at her side, and a little
        travelling-bag on a strap over her shoulder.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [BORGHEIM comes up from the back on the left. He, too, has a
        travelling-bag over his shoulder. He is carrying a rolled-up flag.]
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Catching sight of ASTA.] Oh, so you are up here!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, I am taking my last look out over the fiord.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Then I am glad I happened to come up.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Have you been searching for me?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Yes, I have. I wanted to say good-bye to you for the present.
        Not for good and all, I hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With a faint smile.] You are persevering.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. A road-maker has got to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Have you seen anything of Alfred? Or of Rita?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Yes, I saw them both.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Together?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. No&mdash;apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. What are you going to do with that flag?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Mrs. Allmers asked me to come up and hoist it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Hoist a flag just now?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Half-mast high. She wants it to fly both night and day, she
        says.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Sighing.] Poor Rita! And poor Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Busied with the flag.] Have you the heart to leave them? I
        ask, because I see you are in travelling-dress.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [In a low voice.] I must go.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Well, if you must, then&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. And you are going, too, to-night?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. I must, too. I am going by the train. Are you going that way?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. No. I shall take the steamer.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Glancing at her.] We each take our own way, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        [She sits and looks on while he hoists the flag half-mast high. When he
        has done he goes up to her.]
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Miss Asta&mdash;you can't think how grieved I am about little
        Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looks up at him.] Yes, I am sure you feel it deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. And the feeling tortures me. For the fact is, grief is not
        much in my way.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Raising her eyes to the flag.] It will pass over in time&mdash;all
        of it. All our sorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. All? Do you believe that?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Like a squall at sea. When once you have got far away from here,
        then&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. It will have to be very far away indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. And then you have this great new road-work, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. But no one to help me in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh yes, surely you have.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Shaking his head.] No one. No one to share the gladness with.
        For it is gladness that most needs sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Not the labour and trouble?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Pooh&mdash;that sort of thing one can always get through
        alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. But the gladness&mdash;that must be shared with some one, you
        think?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Yes; for if not, where would be the pleasure in being glad?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Ah yes&mdash;perhaps there is something in that.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Oh, of course, for a certain time you can go on feeling glad
        in your own heart. But it won't do in the long run. No, it takes two to
        be glad.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Always two? Never more? Never many?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Well, you see&mdash;then it becomes a quite different matter.
        Miss Asta&mdash;are you sure you can never make up your mind to share
        gladness and success and&mdash;and labour and trouble, with one&mdash;with
        one alone in all the world?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. I have tried it&mdash;once.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Have you?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, all the time that my brother&mdash;that Alfred and I lived
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Oh, with your brother, yes. But that is altogether different.
        That ought rather to be called peace than happiness, I should say.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. It was delightful, all the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. There now&mdash;you see even that seemed to you delightful.
        But just think now&mdash;if he had not been your brother!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Makes a movement to rise, but remains sitting.] Then we should
        never have been together. For I was a child then&mdash;and he wasn't
        much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [After a pause.] Was it so delightful&mdash;that time?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh yes, indeed it was.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Was there much that was really bright and happy in your life
        then?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh yes, so much. You cannot think how much.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Tell me a little about it, Miss Asta.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, there are only trifles to tell.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Such as&mdash;? Well?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Such as the time when Alfred had passed his examination&mdash;and
        had distinguished himself. And then, from time, to time, when he got a
        post in some school or other. Or when he would sit at home working at an
        article&mdash;and would read it aloud to me. And then when it would
        appear in some magazine.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Yes, I can quite see that it must have been a peaceful,
        delightful life&mdash;a brother and sister sharing all their joys.
        [Shaking his head.] What I cannot understand is that your brother could
        ever give you up, Asta.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With suppressed emotion.] Alfred married, you know.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Was not that very hard for you?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, at first. It seemed as though I had utterly lost him all at
        once.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Well, luckily it was not so bad as that.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. No.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. But, all the same&mdash;how could he! Go and marry, I mean&mdash;when
        he could have kept you with him, alone!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looking straight in front of her.] He was subject to the law of
        change, I suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. The law of change?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. So Alfred calls it.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Pooh&mdash;what a stupid law that must be! I don't believe a
        bit in that law.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Rising.] You may come to believe in it, in time.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Never in all my life! [Insistently.] But listen now, Miss
        Asta! Do be reasonable for once in a way&mdash;in this matter, I mean&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Interrupting him.] Oh, no, no&mdash;don't let us begin upon that
        again!
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Continuing as before.] Yes, Asta&mdash;I can't possibly give
        you up so easily. Now your brother has everything as he wishes it. He
        can live his life quite contentedly without you. He doesn't require you
        at all. Then this&mdash;this&mdash;that at one blow has changed your
        whole position here&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With a start.] What do you mean by that?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. The loss of the child. What else should I mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Recovering her self-control.] Little Eyolf is gone, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. And what more does that leave you to do here? You have not the
        poor little boy to take care of now. You have no duties&mdash;no claims
        upon you of any sort.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, please, Mr. Borgheim&mdash;don't make it so hard for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. I must; I should be mad if I did not try my uttermost. I shall
        be leaving town before very long, rind perhaps I shall have no
        opportunity of meeting you there. Perhaps I shall not see you again for
        a long, long time. And who knows what may happen in the meanwhile?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With a grave smile.] So you are afraid of the law of change,
        after all?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. No, not in the least. [Laughing bitterly.] And there is
        nothing to be changed, either&mdash;not in you. I mean. For I can see
        you don't care much about me.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. You know very well that I do.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Perhaps, but not nearly enough. Not as I want you to. [More
        forcibly.] By Heaven, Asta&mdash;Miss Asta&mdash;I cannot tell you how
        strongly I feel that you are wrong in this! A little onward, perhaps,
        from to-day and to-morrow, all life's happiness may be awaiting us. And
        we must needs pass it by! Do you think we will not come to repent of it,
        Asta?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Quietly.] I don't know. I only know that they are not for us&mdash;all
        these bright possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Looks at her with self-control.] Then I must make my roads
        alone?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Warmly.] Oh, how I wish I could stand by you in it all! Help you
        in the labour&mdash;share the gladness with you&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Would you&mdash;if you could?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes, that I would.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. But you cannot?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looking down.] Would you be content to have only half of me?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. No. You must be utterly and entirely mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Looks at him, and says quietly.] Then I cannot.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Good-bye then, Miss Asta.
      </p>
      <p>
        [He is on the point of going. ALLMERS comes up from the left at the
        back. BORGHEIM stops.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [The moment he has reached the top of the steps, points, and
        says in a low voice.] Is Rita in there&mdash;in the summer-house?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. No; there is no one here but Miss Asta.
      </p>
      <p>
        [ALLMERS comes forward.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Going towards him.] Shall I go down and look for her? Shall I get
        her to come up here?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With a negative gesture.] No, no, no&mdash;let it alone. [To
        BORGHEIM.] Is it you that have hoisted the flag?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Yes. Mrs. Allmers asked me to. That was what brought me up
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. And you are going to start to-night?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Yes. To-night I go away in good earnest.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With a glance at ASTA.] And you have made sure of pleasant
        company, I daresay.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Shaking his head.] I am going alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With surprise.] Alone!
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Utterly alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Absently.] Indeed?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. And I shall have to remain alone, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. There is something horrible in being alone. The thought of it
        runs like ice through my blood&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Oh, but, Alfred, you are not alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. There may be something horrible in that too, Asta.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Oppressed.] Oh, don't talk like that! Don't think like that!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Not listening to her.] But since you are not going with him&mdash;?
        Since there is nothing to bind you&mdash;? Why will you not remain out
        here with me&mdash;and with Rita?
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Uneasily.] No, no, I cannot. I must go back to town now.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. But only in to town, Asta. Do you hear!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. And you must promise me that you will soon come out again.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Quickly.] No, no, I dare not promise you that, for the present.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well as you will. We shall soon meet in town, then.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Imploringly.] But, Alfred, you must stay at home here with Rita
        now.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Without answering, turns to BORGHEIM.] You may find it a good
        thing, after all, that you have to take your journey alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Annoyed.] Oh, how can you say such a thing?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. You see, you can never tell whom you might happen to meet
        afterwards&mdash;on the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Involuntarily.] Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. The right fellow-traveller&mdash;when it is too late&mdash;too
        late.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Softly, quivering.] Alfred! Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [Looking front one to the other.] What is the meaning of this?
        I don't understand&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        [RITA comes up from the left at the back.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Plaintively.] Oh, don't go away from me, all of you!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Going towards her.] You said you preferred to be alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, but I dare not. It is getting so horribly dark. I seem to see
        great, open eyes fixed upon me!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Tenderly and sympathetically.] What if it were so, Rita? You
        ought not to be afraid of those eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. How can you say so! Not afraid!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Insistently.] Asta, I beg you&mdash;for Heaven's sake&mdash;remain
        here with Rita!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes! And with Alfred, too. Do! Do, Asta!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Struggling with herself.] Oh, I want to so much&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Well, then, do it! For Alfred and I cannot go alone through the
        sorrow and heartache.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Darkly.] Say, rather&mdash;through the ranklings of remorse.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, whatever you like to call it&mdash;we cannot bear it alone, we
        two. Oh, Asta, I beg and implore you! Stay here and help us! Take
        Eyolf's place for us&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Shrinking.] Eyolf's&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, would you not have it so, Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. If she can and will.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. You used to call her your little Eyolf. [Seizes her hand.]
        Henceforth you shall be our Eyolf, Asta! Eyolf, as you were before.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With concealed emotion.] Remain&mdash;and share our life with
        us, Asta. With Rita. With me. With me&mdash;your brother!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [With decision, snatches her hand away.] No. I cannot. [Turning.]
        Mr. Borgheim&mdash;what time does the steamer start?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. Now&mdash;at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Then I must go on board. Will you go with me?
      </p>
      <p>
        BORGHEIM. [With a suppressed outburst of joy.] Will I? Yes, yes!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. Then come!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Slowly.] Ah! That is how it is. Well, then, you cannot stay with
        us.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Throwing her arms round her neck.] Thanks for everything, Rita!
        (Goes up to ALLMERS and grasps his hand.) Alfred-good-bye! A thousand
        times, good-bye!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Softly and eagerly.] What is this, Asta? It seems as though
        you were taking flight.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [In subdued anguish.] Yes, Alfred&mdash;I am taking flight.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Flight&mdash;from me!
      </p>
      <p>
        ASTA. [Whispering.] From you&mdash;and from myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shrinking back.] Ah&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        [ASTA rushes down the steps at the back. BORGHEIM waves his hat and
        follows her. RITA leans against the entrance to the summer-house.
        ALLMERS goes, in strong inward emotion, up to the railing, and stands
        there gazing downwards. A pause.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Turns, and says with hard-won composure.] There comes the
        steamer. Look, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I dare not look at it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. You dare not?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No. For it has a red eye&mdash;and a green one, too. Great,
        glowing eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Oh, those are only the lights, you know.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Henceforth they are eyes&mdash;for me. They stare and stare out of
        the darkness&mdash;and into the darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Now she is putting in to shore.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Where are they mooring her this evening, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Coming forward.] At the pier, as usual&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Drawing herself up.] How can they moor her there!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. They must.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. But it was there that Eyolf&mdash;! How can they moor her there!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, life is pitiless, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Men are heartless. They take no thought&mdash;whether for the
        living or for the dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. There you are right. Life goes its own way&mdash;just as if
        nothing in the world had happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Gazing straight before her.] And nothing has happened, either.
        Not to others. Only to us two.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [The pain re-awakening.] Yes, Rita&mdash;so it was to no
        purpose that you bore him in sorrow and anguish. For now he is gone
        again&mdash;and has left no trace behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Only the crutch was saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Angrily.] Be silent! Do not let me hear that word!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Plaintively.] Oh, I cannot bear the thought that he is gone from
        us.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Coldly and bitterly.] You could very well do without him while
        he was with us. Half the day would often pass without your setting eyes
        on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, for I knew that I could see him whenever I wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, that is how we have gone and squandered the short time we
        had with Little Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Listening, in dread.] Do you hear, Alfred! Now it is ringing
        again!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking over the fiord.] It is the steamer's bell that is
        ringing. She is just starting.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, it's not that bell I mean. All day I have heard it ringing in
        my ears.&mdash;Now it is ringing again!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Going up to her.] You are mistaken, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No, I hear it so plainly. It sounds like a knell. Slow. Slow. And
        always the same words.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Words? What words?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Nodding her head in the rhythm.] "The crútch is&mdash;flóating.
        The crútch is&mdash;flóating." Oh, surely you must hear it, too!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] I hear nothing. And there is nothing to
        hear.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, you may say what you will&mdash;I hear it so plainly.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking out over the railing.] Now they are on board, Rita.
        Now the steamer is on her way to the town.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Is it possible you do not hear it? "The crútch is&mdash;flóating.
        The crútch is &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Coming forward.] You shall not stand there listening to a
        sound that does not exist. I tell You, Asta and Borgheim are on board.
        They have started already. Asta is gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looks timidly at him.] Then I suppose you will soon be gone, too,
        Alfred?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Quickly.] What do you mean by that?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. That you will follow your sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Has Asta told you anything?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No. But you said yourself it was for Asta's sake that&mdash;that
        we came together.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes, but you, you yourself, have bound me to you&mdash;by our
        life together.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, in your eyes I am not&mdash;I am not&mdash;entrancingly
        beautiful any more.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. The law of change may perhaps keep us together, none the less.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Nodding slowly.] There is a change in me now&mdash;I feel the
        anguish of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Anguish?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, for change, too, is a sort of birth.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. It is&mdash;or a resurrection. Transition to a higher life.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Gazing sadly before her.] Yes&mdash;with the loss of all, all
        life's happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. That loss is just the gain.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Vehemently.] Oh, phrases! Good God, we are creatures of earth
        after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. But something akin to the sea and the heavens too, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. You perhaps. Not I.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Oh, yes&mdash;you too, more than you yourself suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Advancing a pace towards him.] Tell me, Alfred&mdash;could you
        think of taking up your work again?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. The work that you have hated so?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I am easier to please now. I am willing to share you with the
        book.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Only to keep you here with me&mdash;to have you near me.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Oh, it is so little I can do to help you, Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. But perhaps I could help you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. With my book, do you mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No; but to live your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] I seem to have no life to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Well then, to endure your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Darkly, looking away from her.] I think it would be best for
        both of us that we should part.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looking curiously at him.] Then where would you go? Perhaps to
        Asta, after all?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No&mdash;never again to Asta.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Where then?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Up into the solitudes.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Up among the mountains? Is that what you mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. But all that is mere dreaming, Alfred! You could not live up
        there.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. And yet I feel myself drawn to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Why? Tell me!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Sit down&mdash;and I will tell you something.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Something that happened to you up there?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. And that you never told Asta and me?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, you are so silent about everything. You ought not to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Sit down there&mdash;and I will tell you about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, yes&mdash;tell me!
      </p>
      <p>
        [She sits on the bench beside the summer-house.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I was alone up there, in the heart of the great mountains. I
        came to a wide, dreary mountain lake; and that lake I had to cross. But
        I could not&mdash;for there was neither a boat nor any one there.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Well? And then?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Then I went without any guidance into a side valley. I thought
        that by that way I could push on over the heights and between the peaks&mdash;and
        then down again on the other side of the lake.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, and you lost yourself, Alfred!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes; I mistook the direction&mdash;for there was no path or
        track. And all day I went on&mdash;and all the next night. And at last I
        thought I should never see the face of man again.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Not come home to us? Oh, then, I am sure your thoughts were with
        us here.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No&mdash;they were not.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Not?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. No. It was so strange. Both you and Eyolf seemed to have
        drifted far, far away from me&mdash;and Asta, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Then what did you think of?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I did not think. I dragged myself along among the precipices&mdash;and
        revelled in the peace and luxury of death.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Springing up.] Oh, don't speak in that way of that horror!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I did not feel it so. I had no fear. Here went death and I, it
        seemed to me, like two good fellow-travellers. It all seemed so natural&mdash;so
        simple, I thought. In my family, we don't live to be old&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, don't say such things, Alfred! You see you came safely out of
        it, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes; all of a sudden, I found myself where I wanted to be&mdash;on
        the other side of the lake.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. It must have been a night of terror for you, Alfred. But now that
        it is over, you will not admit it to yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. That night sealed my resolution. And it was then that I turned
        about and came straight homewards. To Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Softly.] Too late.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes. And then when&mdash;my fellow-traveller came and took him&mdash;then
        I felt the horror of it; of it all; of all that, in spite of everything,
        we dare not tear ourselves away from. So earthbound are we, both of us,
        Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [With a gleam of joy.] Yes, you are, too, are you not! [Coming
        close to him.] Oh, let us live our life together as long as we can!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shrugging his shoulders.] Live our life, yes! And have nothing
        to fill life with. An empty void on all sides&mdash;wherever I look.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [In fear.] Oh, sooner or later you will go away from me, Alfred! I
        feel it! I can see it in your face! You will go away from me.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. With my fellow-traveller, do you mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No, I mean worse than that. Of your own free will&mdash;you will
        leave me&mdash;for you think it's only here, with me, that you have
        nothing to live for. Is not that what is in your thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking steadfastly at her.] What if it were&mdash;?
      </p>
      <p>
        [A disturbance, and the noise of angry, quarrelling voices is heard from
        down below, in the distance. ALLMERS goes to the railing.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. What is that? [With an outburst.] Oh, you'll see, they have found
        him!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. He will never be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. But what is it then?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Coming forward.] Only fighting&mdash;as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Down on the beach?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes. The whole village down there ought to be swept away. Now
        the men have come home&mdash;drunk, as they always are. They are beating
        the children&mdash;do you hear the boys crying! The women are shrieking
        for help for them&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Should we not get some one to go down and help them?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Harshly and angrily.] Help them, who did not help Eyolf! Let
        them go&mdash;as they let Eyolf go.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, you must not talk like that, Alfred! Nor think like that!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. I cannot think otherwise. All the old hovels ought to be torn
        down.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. And then what is to become of all the poor people?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. They must go somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. And the children, too?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Does it make much difference where they go to the dogs?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Quietly and reproachfully.] You are forcing yourself into this
        harshness, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Vehemently.] I have a right to be harsh now! It is my duty.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Your duty?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. My duty to Eyolf. He must not lie unavenged. Once for all, Rita&mdash;it
        is as I tell you! Think it over! Have the whole place down there razed
        to the ground&mdash;when I am gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Looks intently at him.] When you are gone?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes. For that will at least give you something to fill your
        life with&mdash;and something you must have.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Firmly and decidedly.] There you are right&mdash;-I must. But can
        you guess what I will set about&mdash;when you are gone?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well, what?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Slowly and with resolution.] As soon as you are gone from me, I
        will go down to the beach, and bring all the poor neglected children
        home with me. All the mischievous boys&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. What will you do with them here?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I will take them to my heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. You!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, I will. From the day you leave me, they shall all be here,
        all of them, as if they were mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shocked.] In our little Eyolf's place!
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, in our little Eyolf's place. They shall live in Eyolf's
        rooms. They shall read his books. They shall play with his toys. They
        shall take it in turns to sit in his chair at table.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. But this is sheer madness in you! I do not know a creature in
        the world that is less fitted than you for anything of that sort.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Then I shall have to educate myself for it; to train myself; to
        discipline myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. If you are really in earnest about this&mdash;about all you say&mdash;then
        there must indeed be a change in you.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Yes, there is, Alfred&mdash;and for that I have you to thank. You
        have made an empty place within me; and I must try to fill it up with
        something&mdash;with something that is a little like love.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Stands for a moment lost in thought; then looks at her.] The
        truth is, we have not done much for the poor people down there.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. We have done nothing for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Scarcely even thought of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Never thought of them in sympathy.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. We, who had "the gold, and the green forests"&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Our hands were closed to them. And our hearts too.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Nods.] Then it was perhaps natural enough, after all, that
        they should not risk their lives to save little Eyolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Softly.] Think, Alfred! Are you so certain that&mdash;that we
        would have risked ours?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [With an uneasy gesture of repulsion.] You must never doubt
        that.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Oh, we are children of earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. What do you really think you can do with all these neglected
        children?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I suppose I must try if I cannot lighten and&mdash;and ennoble
        their lot in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. If you can do that&mdash;then Eyolf was not born in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Nor taken from us in vain, either.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Looking steadfastly at her.] Be quite clear about one thing,
        Rita&mdash;it is not love that is driving you to this.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No, it is not&mdash;at any rate, not yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Well, then what is it?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Half-evasively.] You have so often talked to Asta of human
        responsibility&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Of the book that you hated.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. I hate that book still. But I used to sit and listen to what you
        told her. And now I will try to continue it&mdash;in my own way.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] It is not for the sake of that unfinished
        book&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. No, I have another reason as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. What is that?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Softly, with a melancholy smile.] I want to make my peace with
        the great, open eyes, you see.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Struck, fixing his eyes upon her.] Perhaps, I could join you
        in that? And help you, Rita?
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. Would you?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. Yes&mdash;if I were only sure I could.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Hesitatingly.] But then you would have to remain here.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Softly.] Let us try if it could not be so.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Almost inaudibly.] Yes, let us, Alfred.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Both are silent. Then ALLMERS goes up to the flagstaff and hoists the
        flag to the top. RITA stands beside the summer-house and looks at him in
        silence.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Coming forward again.] We have a heavy day of work before us,
        Rita.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. You will see&mdash;that now and then a Sabbath peace will descend
        on us.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALLMERS. [Quietly, with emotion.] Then, perhaps, we shall know that the
        spirits are with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        RITA. [Whispering.] The spirits?

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
